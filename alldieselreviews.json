I don't mind the width as my wrist is pretty wide to start with, but I wish they would have slimmed down the height a little bit. I can't complain though, as in no way does it detract from the style or comfort of the watch.The wear of the watch is very comfortable. The entire band is leather, and the clasp wraps around so that you don't see the buckle, save for three very small metal pieces holding it on, giving it an even more sleek style. The backlight is dim, but is easily seen. I like this as most watches backlights are on par with how bright my iPod's backlight is, which can be distracting if you're trying to be discreet.All in all, a fresh and stylish watch that won't disappoint you!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Fresh style and functionality.", "unixReviewTime": 1135296000, "reviewTime": "12 23, 2005"}, "B000GHUW46.ADS22OS5N1DUY": {"reviewerID": "ADS22OS5N1DUY", "asin": "B000GHUW46", "reviewerName": "Melissa J.

To be honest, I was expecting it to under-perform, be difficult to set, and hard to see.  I bought it anyway because it looks so nice, and the price is even better.First off... this is a beautiful watch. It is a good blend of class & casual while giving a (not too nerdy) tech edge.The booklet included covers multiple watches. All I did was look at the table of contents to find my model, and flip to the section that deals with the programming for that specific one. I understand the confusion some people are having, as it is only half of one page (out of 1000 pages) that covers how to set this watch properly. It took me less than a minute from opening to get it set to the correct time & date, and to turn off the beeping that happens when pressing buttons.I haven't had any problems viewing the time & date. Sure, it's not as easy to read as black clock hands on a white background, but it's the subtlety of the watch face that makes it so unique. I have been in multiple lighting situations (indoors & out) and have been able to read it just fine.The only thing that I took a star off for is the watch band. This may not be a problem as it wears in... but the band is pretty stiff, and I don't really care for the rough texture on the leather. That's mostly a personal issue... my last watch had a really smooth leather band that I liked a lot. And since I'm the master of this review: STRIKE 1 STAR!", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Very Nice!

And that superb first impression lasted. I've worn this watch 24/7 for 2 months ago and am almost completely happy. The online pictures do not deceive; this watch does look great and true to eye. First off, the reviewers who complain about not being to read the watch are either illiterate or legally blind. Outside during the day, the black background makes the digits stand out, making the whole display 150% legible, and during dark times the backlight works marvelously. In some dusk/dim light, you may not pick out the numbers immediately, but a closer glance or using backlight solves this problem right away. Those scenarios are not very common, so I don't have much of a problem. The stainless steel casing protects against any damage, so now matter how many times I've hit/scraped this watch against objects by now, there's still not a scratch to see. This is my first leather watch, and I think I'm happy with the leather strap. I'm a guy, and I have wrists as thin as a girl's, so I do have to use the tightest or second to last notch on the strap, but it still works fine. I was initially worried about wearing a watch that looked this big, but I'm happy I got it. The wide strap makes it look like an armband, so it doesn't look odd. The rectangular display is a great size. My only complaint is that the instruction booklet definitely is worthless, but I didn't really need to to set my primary time anyway, it works just like any digital watch. So it's not that hard people. There's a review on here that shows exactly how to do. But, I do have some trouble accessing a few of the other functions without proper instructions, like the secondary time setting. Also, the lower horizontal steel line on the front of the display blocks out the display abbreviations when looking straight on at the face. I thought this was pretty stupid of the manufacturers, especially when there's all the other space in the bottom left corner box. You can still those abbreviations hidden underneath the line when tilting the watch and looking from a different angle. Not a big deal really, just dumb. By the way, the strap is starting to give off an odd odor now, but maybe that's because of my wearing habits (I keep it on when I sleep) Well worth the $84, this watch really stands out, and I usually get comments on it.

Pitch dark is not a problem, as there is a night light function. However, intermediate lighting makes it hard to read the time at a glance as the display is passive.* Some of the display is obscured by the crystal guard grill.* The smaller elements of the display, like the 'p' for time, as well as the flags in the bottom left quadrant that indicate functions such as chronometer, timer, Time1, Time2 etc. are almost impossible to see.

Jamani", "helpful": [12, 14], "reviewText": "I bought this watch from the picture alone because I thought it looked pretty cool. However, I am disappointed with its design.My first complaint is that the backlight is not very strong. In fact, when I had just received it, I tried out the light on a cloudy day and my first thought was that the backlight was not working (hence minus one star).My next complaint is that the clock/calendar set button is right next to the the backlight and mode buttons. All 3 buttons have the same feel and and a very low profile. The problem here is that if I want to check the time in the middle of the night, I can't distinguish between the buttons and hence if the light doesn't come on initially it may be because I've pushed the clock setup button or did not push hard enough. Consequently, on a second attempt to find the backlight button, I may end up changing the time. Now what good is it to stress myself in the middle of the night like that when I am trying to sleep.  I think a watch like this or any other watch should have a lock switch on the back so that you cannot accidently alter the time. Alternatively, place the setup button away from the others. (minus another star)Another complaint is that to setup the year, it only advances forward but fortunately it only goes to 2099 and then returns to 2000 again. My son accidently pushed the setup button and the year advanced to 2013. I was afraid that I would not be able to return back to 2008 and that the calendar feature would be useless.It's a pity, with all the technological advances out there and the fact that Diesel has been selling watches for some time now, you would think you could get a well designed feature rich watch.

I've been in a search for a wide-band leather and digital watch for sometime now. After much effort I came upon this watch and it has served me in more ways than one. My intent with this watch was to wear this on the town while in jeans or dark apparel. I needed something less formal than a metal 1k watch which I wear to work. Something I can beat up and not cry a river over.Since this is worn largely at night, I never had an issue with screen since I would have to hit a button to see the time on any watch. This time piece comes across more as a fashion bracelet than a watch. I am quite a small person (5' 5\" with atlentic build) with small wrists (circumference of 17cm), and I never felt this watch was too large for me. Please read below for my critiques.Key features:- Can be set to work in two different time-zones.- Has Chrono, Timer, and 4xAlarms- Can be set to run 24 Hours or 12 Hour format- The ladies love it- Comes in a very impressive white case (I really have no use of it)Flaws:- Useless instruction Manual- Very hard to read screen when worn during the daytime (I had to set the light to \"always be on\" when pressing any button.- Glass is very fragile, its no crystal glass - it will get cracked if dropped. (I already cracked the entire screen in half)- The black paint and on the watch does weather-down a bit. (It adds character!)Instructions: (Courtesy from another reviewer)Instructions To Set The Time On The Diesel DZ7071 WatchOk the first and most important thing to know about this watch is that it has an unusual timezone function (unusual to me at least). This allows the watch to display two different times. Time 1 (or T1) is the primary time (the time of the place where you spend most of your time!). The time can only be adjusted whilst the watch is in the T1 mode (T1 should be displayed in the bottom left corner of the screen). Holding down the top right button for one or two seconds will temporarily replace the current T1 time with the T2 time. Holding down this same button for several seconds will toggle the current time mode to T2 and the watch will continue to function in the second time zone until you toggle it back to T1.The second most important thing to know is that you can only set the time whilst in the T1 mode. When in T1 mode hold down the top left button until the watch enters the settings menu (it should say \"Light\" at the top of the screen) now use the bottom left button to toggle through the settings menu until you get to the time settings. I think this part of the process if sufficiently straight forward so I'm not going to go into more details here, all I'll add is that once you have the watch set to the desired time mode 12h/24h time and date you just need to press the top left button to save the settings and return to the main time screen.To set a secondary timezone time you have to first toggle the watch to the secondary time zone mode (hold the top right button for several seconds and the T1 indicator should change to T2 (and the watch will now be displaying the time that is currently set for the secondary timezone). This time is based on the primary time by simply telling the watch a number of whole hours ahead or behind the primary time. To adjust this hold down the top left button for several seconds, the watch will then say \"offset\" now use the buttons on the right to add or subtract hours from the primary time. Once set press the top left button again to return to the main time screen. Finally hold down the top right button for several seconds once more to return the watch to the T1 mode.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Beautiful Watch with Critical Flaws", "unixReviewTime": 1299888000, "reviewTime": "03 12, 2011"}, "B000PC0T72.A1PML5YR4FTCTB": {"reviewerID": "A1PML5YR4FTCTB", "asin": "B000PC0T72", "reviewerName": "Amazon Customer", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "I bought this item as a gift, and it looks so much better in person than it does on the screen.

I was looking at it online for a few days thinking if I should get it because normally I am not big on diesel watches simply because they look cheap.

The 'mineral glass' (whatever that means) is tinted yellow so it makes the glow in the dark parts of the hour and minute hand useless because you can not see them.

These are much handier than busting out the cell phone, you have your day and date right in front of you and the quarts movement has for the last month kept excellent time. There is only one knob which is small and does not accidentally move as well as being easy to operate.This is a truly awesome watch if you like something with a bit of an industrial look that looks/works great on casual days off or if you are doing work that doesn't require dress clothes.

Well, for those shoes, this is precisely the case. I am not a fan of Diesel shoes in general (the look does not appeal to me), but this particular style with the 20s reference in the T-strap, the 30s reverse wingtip, 50s multicolour and especially the fact that it was available in green topped with the raving reviews made me curious enough to make a purchase.Pros: First - the fit - I wear 39 in shoes made in Italy and those fit perfectly length and width wise. On the little label on the inside of the shoe it says \"US 8.5\" so I guess opposite to the other review, it fits true to size and width. The T-strap comes high enough and the ankle strap is a good length. Second - the color combination is very modern, easy to wear with lots of stuff. The heel is in the neighbourhood of 4\" but if you are used to high heels, those shoes are easy to walk on.Cons: When I first got the shoes, I was shocked that none of the reviewers mentioned the glue that was showing around the sole. Also the leather although good is not great. I had mine one time and the fine velour on the heel started to peel off where my pants were rubbing in. Basically it is a good shoe in the $30 price range, anything more is simply not worth it.Probably I am spoiled when it comes to shoes, but the craftsmanship on those is awful.

When I read the reviews I was disappointed about the lack of useful information because while I am happy to learn that someone thinks her legs look great in the shoes I am more interested in how the shoes fit.Even though I am JUST on the sane side of being a total shoe freak, I'd never heard of Diesel shoes so I had no idea about the sizing. I normally wear 8 1/2 to a 9 in pumps, depending on the brand, but these jumped from 9 to 10 so I ordered the 10.  A 9 1/2 would have been a perfect fit and I believe a 9 would have been agony! As it is, a gel insole will take care of the excess wiggle room and just make a comfortable shoe even more so.  The company put some thought into comfort as well as beauty because there is extra cushioning in the heel as well as the ball of the foot, so a gel insert is not something that you need to factor in when figuring out what size to order.The product info states the heels are 3 1/2 inches and they are, if you only measure to the shortest point of the heel.  From the rubber tip to the top of the heel is 4\" with a narrow platform which is just over a 1/4 of an inch. The heel as depicted in the pictures is a good sturdy one, as opposed to the oh so wobbly spike heel, so that extra 1/2 inch is pretty much not an issue unless there is a reason why you are limited to 3 1/2 inch heels. I have a medium width foot and the width on these shoes is perfect for me.  I think anyone with a narrow or wide foot would have problems.  The ankle strap is nice and long so for anyone who thinks she has cankles, you won't feel as though you are strangling your ankle just by trying to close your shoes.  Unfortunately, the T-strap is just a little too long so it doesn't quite lay flat along the foot as you are walking along, but it is not so bad that I would  take  away a star for it.I have walked around my house wearing these shoes for a couple of hours and so far, no rubbing or toes screaming for release.  For the cherry on top, you can stand up straight while walking, unlike some heels where the angle is so steep you look like you are about to pitch forward onto your face.  We all have great looking heels in our closet which are perfect, if you only have to walk from the car to the restaurant or theater seat.  These shoes not only look good on your feet, they still FEEL good after hours of walking or standing, which we all know is very rare.  You can dress these shoes up or down which makes them very versatile, skinny jeans or that little black dress whichever you choose, these shoes will complement the outfit perfectly!These shoes are a GREAT deal at $22.99 but when you order them in US sizes the price jumps to $57.99, for the exact same shoe and fit by the way!  I ordered the Alpine/Taupe, which turned out to be more like Sage/Moss with the lighter green in leather while the darker green, including the heel made of suede.  The White/Dk Plum/Rosedust pair is more like Purple leather with Eggshell or Offwhite suede and the Rosedust is a very understated pale pink suede scalloping between the purple leather and eggshell suede. So for those of you who live in areas where wet stuff falls from the sky these will not be shoes you can wear year round.  For others like myself, who call the desert home, there will be no reason to wait, you can order these and be raking in the compliments by next week.

I think that the watch looks a lot nicer in the real life than it does in the pictures and the quality is very good for the price.I have given the five star rating because of the overall quality, practicality and appearance of the product.The only fault I've found so far is in the provided instruction manual. The instructions booklet is fairly thick but is a generic manual that covers several Diesel watch models in several different languages. That would be perfectly acceptable if it weren't for the fact that this model itself is not covered at all.So having fiddled for quite a while I have finally managed to work out how to set the time - here is what the Diesel manual doesn't (and really should) tell you...Instructions To Set The Time On The Diesel DZ7071 WatchOk the first and most important thing to know about this watch is that it has an unusual timezone function (unusual to me at least). This allows the watch to display two different times. Time 1 (or T1) is the primary time (the time of the place where you spend most of your time!). The time can only be adjusted whilst the watch is in the T1 mode (T1 should be displayed in the bottom left corner of the screen). Holding down the top right button for one or two seconds will temporarily replace the current T1 time with the T2 time. Holding down this same button for several seconds will toggle the current time mode to T2 and the watch will continue to function in the second time zone until you toggle it back to T1.The second most important thing to know is that you can only set the time whilst in the T1 mode. When in T1 mode hold down the top left button until the watch enters the settings menu (it should say \"Light\" at the top of the screen) now use the bottom left button to toggle through the settings menu until you get to the time settings. I think this part of the process if sufficiently straight forward so I'm not going to go into more details here, all I'll add is that once you have the watch set to the desired time mode 12h/24h time and date you just need to press the top left button to save the settings and return to the main time screen.To set a secondary timezone time you have to first toggle the watch to the secondary time zone mode (hold the top right button for several seconds and the T1 indicator should change to T2 (and the watch will now be displaying the time that is currently set for the secondary timezone). This time is based on the primary time by simply telling the watch a number of  whole hours ahead or behind the primary time. To adjust this hold down the top left button for several seconds, the watch will then say \"offset\" now use the buttons on the right to add or subtract hours from the primary time. Once set press the top left button again to return to the main time screen. Finally hold down the top right button for several seconds once more to return the watch to the T1 mode.I hope these instructions prove useful to somebody out there (I know they would have been for me as I spent quite a while trying to figure it out whilst in T2 mode).If I could give a score of 4.5 (or 9/10) then I would simply because of the utterly useless manual, however since the watch itself is so good I have been good enough to overlook the manual and give the full five stars.Diesel if you are reading this please note that a simple couple of pages would have been enough to cover what people need to know about setting up this watch.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great watch, shame about the instructions", "unixReviewTime": 1230163200, "reviewTime": "12 25, 2008"}, "B000VDA5YC.A2QV2ND9WQS88V": {"reviewerID": "A2QV2ND9WQS88V", "asin": "B000VDA5YC", "reviewerName": "Fredrik", "helpful": [6, 6], "reviewText": "I just recieved my watch today.

Since I can't, I'll round down to 3. (Another reviewer rounded up to 5 from 4.5, so my rounding down seems fair in balance.)Yes, it's very attractive. It also has some features that are thoughtful. For example, it's alternate time zone can be viewed either temporarily or more permanently. (Better than the Casio I had where you could accidentally change time zones too easily.) Another example: the \"Auto EL\" option that allows any of the four buttons to turn on the light. Or, when the chime is turned on, toggling the modes changes the pitch of the sound when you arrive back in the \"time\" mode. (This makes working with the watch easier when it's dark or you can't look directly at the watch all the time you're adjusting it.)However, the contrast is fairly low between the digits and the background, making it fairly hard to read the time. Secondly, the \"T1\" indicator that tells you you're viewing the time in the primary time zone is not only miniscule but it actually appears behind one of the metal horizontal crossbars on the watch face so you can't see it!Others have mentioned the problem with the manual: Many pages for other models, and no explicit mention of this one! (Use the instructions for MD-FL298X.) This is really inexcusable.When you figure out that MD-FL298X is the right model to use, even then not all of the instructions are there. For example, you have to find a different model (BD3000) for explanations of the \"auto EL\" and chime functions.I'm not going to use the chronograph or alarm functions, so I'm not reviewing them. (I'll use my iPhone's Clock application instead: much easier interface!)

I've always been attracted to Diesel's style in their timepieces, and this one was no exception. They released this watch along with a brown version at the same time a few years ago, and I received the latter as a gift back then. I loved the other watch, I received a lot of compliments on it, but with its bold, yellow face, the style was (depending on the outfit and occasion) just a little too out there. Also, the leather band on it started to crease and fail on one side near the watch face after accidentally pulling that band too far backward.ANYWAYS,The time is huge and quite easy to read. If you can't read the time on this sucker you seriously (not even kidding about this) need to get your eyes checked. I don't even know how you would even attempt to read an analog watch with smaller numbers and a small needle pointing to them. This watch is huge, it's manly, the face is at least 2\" x 2\" and it is much brighter in person than in the product image. Also, THIS WATCH INCLUDES A nice BACKLIGHT that lights up the time only. This is another reason why I was attracted to this watch, the backlight (combined with the negative face) brightens the time only. I prefer alarm clocks that brighten the numbers only, versus shining a bright background that you have to see through to read the dark numbers within. It's efficient, it's easier on the eyes.In 6 months, I can't even count the amount of compliments I've gotten on this watch. I'll pull up my sleeves and I'll immediately get stares, mostly from women, although a few guys have commented. It's sharp, classy, and an eye-catcher. A few women even asked me to take it off to more personally check it out. Also, truth be told, it's the watch Sam Rockwell wears in the movie, Moon (2009), where he's a studly space cadet.PROS: This watch goes with any outfit. It's sexy.

So if you like your shoes tight, these are not for you. They have laces but don't lace. It has a tighteneing device which you push up and down, very similar to what is found on backpacks and such. It is very convenient for me being pregnant so I don't have to bend and lace. I just slip on and go. So far I've worn them with and w/o socks and they look and feel fabulous.

I agree with other reviews that this definitely feels better when your not wearing any socks or if you wearing very thin socks- my main recommendation  would be to get these shoes a size bigger than from what you wear- mainly because they're very tight fitting. Oh yeah and these shoes show a lot of lint and hair because of the strange black fade- i have two siamese cats and their light brownish hairs kinda show on the shoe- so I also recommend staying away from shedding animals or at least buy a lint remover.

First off, the shoe seems to be very high grade. The leather is soft and supple.The tag claims a man made sole for the shoe as well, and most of the stitching is to a high standard, but the padding insert on the right shoe was poorly aligned and defective.This causes the insert to bunch up on the outside and the sole is left bare on the inside. The shoe deserves 2 if all are like this, though I may have gotten an exception to Diesel's shoe quality. I know the 1st pair I received and returned that was too large was very well made, so I will give Diesel the benefit of the doubt.Fortunately the left shoe is perfect and based on that shoe, this is indeed a very comfortable choice. Now after 3 months of wearing them 4-5 days a week typically ( I usually have 3 pairs of shoes I use for different purposes), I have found the right shoe wearing prematurely. The left shoe has maintained a high comfort level and the leather has proven durable for a sneaker by not tearing up when I incdentally beat on them.Though the color offerings are all good with several distinctly different and creative combos, I chose the classic black/black. The shoe looks great, though I would have preferred the painted diesel logo had been in gold rather than white, as on the black/white color. The #78 raised in the leather on back of the heel adds a great touch and is something you would only see in a high-design shoe like this.I prefer the style of this over my Adidas Sambas. These look so much more unique. The Sambas lasted 3 years roughly, and are not yet beat beyond being wearable. I hope these diesels hold up as well.This shoe seems to run true to size, contrary to what  many other reviews of Diesel shoes say by claiming they run small. This caused me to order the fisrt pair too large. So it must be only certain styles that run small in deisel men's shoes. Also, the shoe is made in Vietnam and not China.-----------------------Well, it has been nearly 5 months and my Diesels are still holding up, despite having had a defective right shoe (amazon did refund me for this pair). The mis-aligned insert sort of formed to my foot finally and broke away where it was overhanging. So, it is not so noticeable now after a very, very lengthy break in.The left shoe is just as comfrotable as ever, Though because of the initial problems with the right foot shoe, It is wearing ahead of the left.

It wasn't heavy though. I didn't notice any difference from regular digital watches as far as weight on my wrist goes. It's just big from the style (the works behind the clock and the wrapping band). Other cuff watches for women have the same complaints, so I decided a cuff watch is not for me unless I were to wear short sleeves or sleeveless shirts all the time. That's not possible. So I returned this watch and bought a slim sport watch instead. This watch also has a clapse that's hard to figure out if you've never seen one before. It's a hinge you have to snap oven first before you attach the other end of the band to it. I noticed Nike's cuff watches for women has the same style fasteners.

The rashes from cheap metal clasps and other metal surfaces are no longer a problem with this one.(+5 stars)COULD BE BETTERs: I find the day/date window indispensable - one of the reasons I settled on this particular model - although the minute and hour hands do obscure it when pointing at or near 3 o'clock. This should have been better handled in the design phase. Also, I would like to have a design on the rubber wristband to carry the look of the watch around the wrist. The plainness of the band is a bit of a let down.(-0 stars)CONs: I just mailed the watch back to be fixed under the 2 year warrantee. I  have to pay the shipping both ways according to Diesel. The head of the watch stem came off and I couldn't reattach it although I tried several times. There is also condensate inside the watch crystal that concerns me. Not sure how this will affect the life of the watch. The watch has been treated carefully - no rough stuff - so that hasn't been an issue. I'm in my 60's so touch football isn't part of my routine. I believe a great design deserves better construction than it apparently has. (-1 star)SUMMARY: My old Seiko is on my wrist now and running like a champ.

They are even prettier than pictured. I got mine (my daughter's, to be exact) in purple and the color is very nice, nicer than pictured, it's a warmer, deeper purple. They also appear to be very warm and fairly comfortable and lightweight, though I'm a bit concerned that the sole is not very flexible, it hardly bends. I love the fact that these boots double as snowboots and just regular everyday winter boots - they are waterproof and make great snowboots, but they are also pretty, dressy and comfy enough for everyday wear. The upper is made of suede and nylon, the texture is similar to that of a puffer jacket, and the material is rather thick, which makes the boots really warm. The inside is lined with very soft corduroy and the inner sole is made of leather. The velcro closures make it fast and easy to put the boots on and take them off. The only thing that sort of surprised me was the fur - I had no idea it was real. It does say here that they are rabbit fur trimmed, but I didn't purchase these boots on Amazon, I bought them from another website that didn't mention anything about real fur. I assumed that the fur was fake, it did look fake to me when I was looking at the images of the boots online. When the boots arrived, I was surprised by how soft the fur felt to the touch - much softer than I expected, and then I found a label on the inside of the boots that said \"100% rabbit fur\". I was rather unpleasantly surprised, because it never even occured to me that the fur could be real. It was used only for trimming, the inside of the boot is not lined with fur, it was used for decoration purposes only...I didn't think they would use real fur in children's boots just for decoration purposes. I know that a lot of people feel very strongly about real fur and real fur products and do not wish to buy them so I thought I'd write a review to let everyone know that the fur is real, not fake.

No. I have a very small wrist just like I do ankles but i'm a little more than average built guy so i personally think it is all about how you wear it and with what. I have a big bike and i like silver jewelry and big rings but in good taste and not to exagerated so with two rings on one hand a thick silver bracelet on same hand, nice medium thick necklace and my big watch on the other hand it makes a cool statement of a confident man in my opinion. When other guys see it the go \"deng man, that is a big watch, and then they look and look and start to like it\" they start to see confidence and attitude in me and i like that. Will i wear it with a Toxedo? maybe not but when i get on my bike and put on my jacket and all that and i'm hanging with my friends. Everyone loves the look. I personnaly bought it because of the convinience in having different times set for different countries that i visit or people i call. All i hae to do is look and immediately know what time it is in Thailand where my girlfriend lives, or when it is a good time to call my mother in North Click.

Superb outer. The feel of the lambskin is fantastic. It looks very glossy in the Amazon product picture but in reality it looks like regular faded cow leather (but SO MUCH softer). It's NOT a deep black color at all. Keep in mind that there may be grain or color \"imperfections\" due to this being premium custom leather product. Personally I think these imperfections add to the character of the jacket. The inner is made of cotton and is very plain and thin for such an expensive jacket, so I'm taking off a star for that.2. Unique Fit. Size tends to run smaller than expected. A typical size S jacket is loose for me, but this jacket size S is very snug. You will not be able to comfortably layer more than 1 piece (tee/long-sleeve/sweater) under this jacket. It does stretch out to your body contours after wearing it a few times for an even better fit. This jacket is cut and fits like a slim-fit/modern-fit SHIRT and is made to be worn buttoned up. This jacket looks like GARBAGE if you wear it completely unbuttoned.3. Unusual collar. Pay close attention to the jacket collar before purchase. This collar is very unique for a leather jacket. It will NOT combine well with everything and you may hate it or love it. At first the collar made me consider returning it, but after I wore it with different types of shirts, it really grew on me.Summary: Leather jackets are usually lumped together in the \"Outerwear\" category. I hesitate to call this jacket outwear. Think of it as more like a leather \"blazer\". It's fairly thin for a jacket and would not keep you very warm. With the right shirt combination, you can have a very unique and stylish look with this jacket. Wearing it all buttoned up gives you a stuffy, martial look.I would NOT recommend this for top-heavy people (broad back or wide chest).", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Pricey but unique", "unixReviewTime": 1288396800, "reviewTime": "10 30, 2010"}, "B002RS6HBY.AX2B54SXI0IPM": {"reviewerID": "AX2B54SXI0IPM", "asin": "B002RS6HBY", "reviewerName": "Windmills", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "First off, the jacket runs a bit small - large on 6'1 180 is pretty snug, though it gives the jacket a nice fitted look.  Definitely consider going up a size if you don't want a snug fit from your normal jacket size.  (This includes the sleeves - there is very little extra room in the sleeves as well so consider that if you plan to wear this layered with heavy sweaters/ sweatshirts.)The jacket is fairly light weight - just a thick cotton shell, no extra lining/ padding.  For me this is a plus as well as I have plenty of heavier jackerts and was looking for something light weight for the Fall.I would have rated it 4 stars (very good jacket, but nothing spectacular), but it loses a star for the snap buttons.  When I opened the jacket, I noticed it came with a small zip lock bag full of tons of extra snap button components which I thought was a bit odd.  (Having a few extra buttons is pretty standard, but this is a bag full of the parts that make up a snap button, which would need special tools to actually replace on the jacket.)  As soon as I tried on the jacket, I unbottoned the first snap on the collar to test out the fold out hood, and the snap completely broke.  I don't have the tools needed to assemble/attach a new snap so until I can get those, my brand new jacket is missing a snap on the collar -_-All in all it appears to be a good jacket for the Amazone sale price, and it has a great look in my opinion, but I would only recommend this product at the sale price, definitely not worth the full listed price.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Nice Light-Weight Jacket With A Couple Of Issues", "unixReviewTime": 1283212800, "reviewTime": "08 31, 2010"}, "B002RS6HTQ.A1DSBI82UWZBS8": {"reviewerID": "A1DSBI82UWZBS8", "asin": "B002RS6HTQ", "reviewerName": "M.

When I first noticed that the shoes were starting to get (and look) dirty I was able to clean them and almost completely restore them to their original look, after that - not so much. No matter what I tried or how much I cleaned them, I was only able to make them look a little less dirty, but never completely clean. Right now white fabric and light pink suede parts look almost completely grey, and all suede looks completely worn out. The sneakers still fit my daughter, but they are completely destroyed, I have to throw them out and get something else.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Very pretty, but not at all durable.", "unixReviewTime": 1311379200, "reviewTime": "07 23, 2011"}, "B002SXNWX4.A3B4Q43NEBBQEH": {"reviewerID": "A3B4Q43NEBBQEH", "asin": "B002SXNWX4", "reviewerName": "Youssef", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "be carful as the sizes for this item is not correct, i bought XL as it should have been from 34 to 36 inches while i received 36 to 38 inches", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "wrong sizes guidance", "unixReviewTime": 1290470400, "reviewTime": "11 23, 2010"}, "B002U9JNMU.A2K2NBR5RACYVX": {"reviewerID": "A2K2NBR5RACYVX", "asin": "B002U9JNMU", "reviewerName": "bluebuoy", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewText": "Love the watch, have had it for several months and no problems.

Like the other Diesel watch I own it is a little on the bulky side. The instruction manual that comes with it has instructions for about 30 different watches, so it can be a little confusing until you find the right one. The watch itself is great. The only downside is the wriststrap. It can be a little stiff and hard to take on and off. I am also wary that it might start fracturing and coming apart like the plastic strap on my other Diesel watch. So far it had not done so, and I will update review if it does(so if no edit assume it's still fine).If you like the look of the watch, it's well worth the price; Diesel makes a great quality product, and even if the strap on this one breaks like my last one it'll last a couple years first.EDIT: I've had this watch for awhile and finally something went wrong with it. The silver colored bar along the side of the watch popped off. It's just glued on there it seems. Considering I've had the watch almost a year, and it's an easy fix, not worried about it.

Well, the shirt arrived today and I like the quality, the fit, the material it's made of (super soft pure cotton), the shirt is true to size (size Medium fits US size 6) and is soft and comfortable...I like everything except the design and the overall look. The design is a lot bolder and brighter than it appears in the photos and even though I absolutely love the concept (golden foil print on black or white), I wish it were executed a bit better. The design takes up the entire front of the shirt, it's too big for my liking, and the way the whole thing is shaped makes for a really unflattering look - it looks like you are wearing a breastplate. And since a medieval knight in (really-really) shining armor is not quite the look I was opting for, I'm now considering sending this shirt back. I'm giving it three stars because I wasn't disappointed in its quality, fit or sizing - it's the design and the look that I didn't like, and I don't want to rate this item too low just because of that.

I got mine in black and it looks pretty good with jeans...I just think it would look a lot better if the design were smaller and a little bit more tasteful.UPDATE: I purchased the same shirt in white and I think it looks much better than the one in black - the foil print doesn't stand out on it as much as it does on the black shirt, it looks a lot more subtle and tasteful.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Didn't like the design", "unixReviewTime": 1275350400, "reviewTime": "06 1, 2010"}, "B002VBWBIA.AYQO1JN4J0K10": {"reviewerID": "AYQO1JN4J0K10", "asin": "B002VBWBIA", "reviewerName": "JJAnn \"Love My Dog\"", "helpful": [1, 3], "reviewText": "Poor Quality TShirt for the Price paid,  just because it has a Diesel Logo on it and even that is just a poor quality Iron on.

This is my first Diesel. Only drawbacks here are legibility and thickness.A few observations:  It's a nice looking watch, thicker than I was expecting - a good 12mm - which makes it look a tad awkward IMO, protruding from the wrist. Gotta lash it down tight to compensate. Face + bezel is a good 47mm from side to side, but it doesn't look much oversized because the strap is nice and wide - almost 1\" wide - complementing the fat face.The leftmost and bottom subdial are a stopwatch.  Left is the minutes elapsed and bottom is seconds elapsed. Hit the reset button and the hands unwind however many rotations it takes to undo the time measured. Rightmost dial simply shows the 24-hour cycle.Note the dial markings and hands are chromed, except the luminescent spots, which means it helps to have reflected light to read the time.  Not a problem outdoors, but indoors markings can be low-contrast. At times takes a few seconds to figure out the hand positions.  Speaking of luminescence, it's nice, but usefulness is marginal as it fades pretty soon.Supposedly it's water resistant enough to take skin diving (according to the manual)- 10 BAR. My watch did not come with the correct manual.  The manual that came in the box covers maybe a dozen watches, but not this model (DZ 4165). :( oh well - I decided I don't need it badly enough to contact the seller, Dexclusive.The backplate is screwed down. The window crystal is domed for strength, yet the bulge means it'll contact rough surfaces if given the opportunity. Not sure how scratch-proof it is. I've only had it for a week or so and it doesn't appear to be running fast or slow.We wary of Amazon's \"black/blue\" color description. I figured it was simply wrong, but discovered after ordering that Diesel does make a black/blue model (blue faced).  However, vendor Dexclusive shipped the pictured black/silver/yellow color scheme I was hoping for.  Crisis averted.*** July 18 2012 update ***The watch fell a couple feet onto a tile floor.  The chrome trim that rings the date window broke loose and now rattles freely around the watch face.  No longer glued in place, it can (and did) interfere with movement of the hands.*** July 30 2012 update ***Still ticking after visiting a water park.  Submerged the watch many times and it was not affected by the water.  Window crystal is still unscratched. &lt;3 The loose trim piece (mentioned above) has wedged itself into a corner so it's not currently interfering with the hands.

I even notice it glowing at times I don't expect like when walking down a slightly darker hall, reaching into my locker, or grabbing something from my backpack, which is always a nice surprise! As for the colour, the picture I don't feel accurately portrays this.  When I got the watch it looked white to me!  However, when wearing it outside where the snow is it showed more of a yellowish greenish colour, but never appeared the colour it is in the picture.  Much more of a toned down colour.  Also, this watch is not transparent in any way.  In the picture it looked to be slightly see through to me, but it is definitely an opague silicone that is used for it!

The difference being it's super flexible and it's not stiff at all.  Just an observation not a criticism.But the one thing that really annoyed me was the shape of the heel and I guess the height of the sole. It curves in so much and isn't very high (the sole) that my pant legs would get under the sole of the shoes.  I'm not one of those people who like long pant legs that drag on the ground.  I don't have this problem with any of my other shoes or sneakers.  I bought to wear these for slightly dressier situations but I look a little silly because I have to roll my pants up so they look short on me (which I don't need to do for my other shoes).  It's not that my pants are dragging on the ground.  The issue isn't when you're just standing there.  But when you move and \"swing\" your leg at some point in the arc the pant leg gets under the sole and gets a little caught so you feel like something is messing with your walk.  Once your feet are on the ground, the pant leg is fine.  It feels like there a little hiccup in your step as you walk.If I had bought these for the Amazon price, I'd be returning them no question.

They say the platform wedge is 'out' for 2012, but darn if I haven't loved the recent sky high trend in platform boots. So because I have so many 6 inch-ers in the closet, the more modest heel and fabulous bright but not glaringly bold color really caught my eye. (Think the shade of a grape popsicle dipped in plum sauce.) Diesel's price had me questioning this tho...as the intentional weathering/scuffing thing so many designers are doing really just makes shoes look beat up, not cool. (in case the photos here don't show up well, there is a lot of intentional abuse to the toe and heel.) But the Unkle Jessy has some redeeming factors: color, comfort, casual chic-ness. The lighter colored canvas toggle embellishment on the shaft distracts a bit, IMO, but overall I found these ideal for tees and jeans. The boot runs a wee bit large, on me, a size 9. But the material used on the sole/heel feels nice and cushy and is non-slip too. Always a good thing, tho it'll be hard to dress them up if that's your goal.  It's challenging to rate the quality of suede because it's rather thin, and, as mentioned, beat up. Had these not been pre-aged, I don't think the suede would be anything to write home about. The toe box is roomy and the shaft dimension is generous-- too generous if you don't want to tuck your skinny jeans. I'd prefer a more form fitting opening for versatility. Bottom line is if you catch them on sale and feel your wardrobe is lacking purple boots, I think these are comfy enough to take a gamble on and unique enough to know not every other chick in the room will be rocking this exact style.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Purple boots?

As well, I went against previous experiences with online orders and got a medium instead of a small, and it's a perfect fit, very slim-fitting.BUT, the reason I give it 3 stars is because of a very important flaw. The dozen or so buttons all over the coat are extremely poorly sewn onto the coat, and to my great annoyance, after ONE, just one use, I came home to find two of those buttons missing from the coat! Now provided with the coat are three replacement buttons of varying size, and while I was able to repair the coat, I will need to re-sew all of the other buttons to ensure they are not lost as well.

I say this because I had previously returned an authentic pair to a Buckle store because they were too short, plus a much better price was available on Amazon.  This was a big mistake though since the pair that I received from Amazon appeared to have a thicker denim, which was much different than what I had worn the day before from Buckle, and the sizing was way off.  Authentic Diesel jeans such as this model use a thin, quality denim that has a somewhat smooth elastic feel while fake Diesel jeans often use a thicker denim of less quality.  Even though these pair of jeans seem to have a genuine label that features tiny, hard to read numbers that appear below the Indian head tag, the overall quality is not up to par.

Yes I am aware of the brand name Diesel, and extension of Fossil, yaddie ya, ya. I own a pair of Fossil leather boots that I paid $79.00 for and they are of a much higher quality than these. The boots in all practical appearances seem rugged, (triple stitching, sole sewn to boot, etc.) The toe and heel are not sturdy, and flimsy at best. People let me tell you, NO LINING WHAT SO EVER. The leather outer doubles as the lining. The boot is reinforce with another material at the heel and toe, surely not leather and closer to cardboard. I only got one set of shoe strings. The padded collar, cloth material, is not soft, so you better have on some socks. This boot is great for looks only and will do fine in cool dry weather. Water proof; NOT! Defense against cold weather; NOT! Work boot related; NOT! PROFILING ONLY; yes. So just what did I pay for; you got it, the Diesel name. I have wore boots for almost 30 years, Guess, Doc Martens, The Timberland Boot Company, Aldo, Georgia Boot, Red Wing, etc., no comparison even remotely other than the fact, it falls into the boot category. Top notch Cambodian quality. China would have definitely been a better choice for outsourcing.So, from strictly a fashion stand point, I can work with them, but not for $180.00.

I've never been disappointed with their merchandise and now they've given me another reason to buy again.The Loop On is very comfortable (comfort and style rarely go hand in hand), seems to built well, and feels more like a sports shoe wrapped in a pretty package. I appreciate the subtlety of the design, especially the small and unapparent Diesel logos (some other brands love to use you as a billboard). There are no laces as I initially thought, they are simulated elastic laces, so say goodbye to wasting time tying your shoes, there are more important things to do, like seduce various women with your awesome shoes.

Im a HUGE fan of the HUGE chronograph, and there are several of different brands that I dig.I tell the guy what kind of watch Im looking for and in a milli second, he spins this case around, with all of these Diesels in it. Many, if not most of them, are showcased here on this site.

I was fawning over the thing so bad, the guy literally gives me another Diesel that a guy had dropped on the floor, right before I approached the seller!!!!...it was a HUGE white chronograph!!!..exactly like the black one, here. Anyone could see the scratch and very slight dent in it on the side, only if they held up right to their eyeball. Otherwise, from a distance, there was no way anyone could see it. So, I bought the black one and this guy gives me the other one for free!!...I COULD NOT BELIEVE WHAT WAS HAPPENING!!So, I must be living right, because Ive never had that kind of luck....for a VERY fleeting moment, I almost refused it, when the guy offered it, but couldnt bring myself to do it. I love this watch, and I would recommend it to those who love huge-faced watches, with an edge.

However . . . it isn't even in the same league as this Diesel. This is a really gigantic watch, 65mm (literally more than 2.5 inches for those who are unfamiliar with the metric system). Any bigger, and the strap wouldn't fit because it would be wider than my wrist. The TW Steel watch is a bit heavier and more solid than this one, although this one *looks* every bit as solid. This one is signficantly less expensive if you were to look at both in a watch store (I noticed Amazon has some pretty good deals on TW Steel right now).While it *does* have 4 different time zones (one is digital), I only use two of them. It also has a fifth clock which is hour-only that shows military time for the main clock (also helpful to tell how to set it so the date changes at midnight). The main draw for me was the size and the look.Considering all of the dials on the screen, it is painfully easy to set. There is an old-fashioned pull-knob for each of the 3 analog dials, two buttons for the digital clock and two buttons for the stopwatch (yes, this makes a total of four buttons and 3 knobs). Each button or knob is right next to the particular dial you need, so it is very intuitive.I only have two complaints, both of which are extremely minor. One, while not a wildly expensive watch . . . I don't think that it would be THAT difficult for Diesel to put a manual for the specific watch in the box. It has the 400-page all-in-one manual. However the watch is SO easy to use I can't imagine why you'd even need the manual. The second complaint is that it doesn't have a light. Again, extremely minor . . . but since it has a digital clock on it I would think that there would be a light for it. I don't expect one for the analog sections. :)I technically have a third complaint, although it is my own fault. I just thought that I'd throw it in here in case it might influence your color scheme choice. The black watch with black everything (which is my kind of style) *is* a bit hard to read in a lot of lighting situations. The background is matte and the hands are shiny, so in direct light it is easy to see.Scott", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "*REALLY* big watch:", "unixReviewTime": 1333238400, "reviewTime": "04 1, 2012"}, "B004JW0DMK.A16UBVD8QQ8BOS": {"reviewerID": "A16UBVD8QQ8BOS", "asin": "B004JW0DMK", "reviewerName": "Stephanie", "helpful": [7, 7], "reviewText": "The watch is really beattifull but if you are not looking for a big watch, this isn't for you.Really fast shipping...

It's not heavy - most of the time, you won't realize you're wearing it.The digital readout is difficult to read when the watch is at angle, but if you're holding the watch squarely to check the time, you won't have any trouble.The manual that comes with the watch is huge and it covers a number of Diesel watches and is in a variety of languages.

However over the last 2 years, I've seen Diesel shoes return to the style that made me like them originally.The Diesel Eagle Loop On Athlesure (White) shoes fit exact to size for me (US 11) and are extremely comfortable. The inside padding is thick, and has an almost pillow like quality surrounding the heel, arch and inner sides, making the shoe a very snug (in a good way) fit. I have ample toe room so if I'm sitting or driving for a prolonged period of time, I can wiggle my toes and even \"stretch\" them if they get tired. While I have room to move my toes, its not because the shoe is too big, it is truly one of the only brand of shoes that actually fit true to size for me, the other brand being Dr. Martens.The style of the shoe is exactly what I like in a casual, designer shoe. The shoe is designed with sharp angled stitching and soles that complement the soft rounded silhouette/shape of the whole shoe. They go great with a pair of Dark or Light Jeans, cargo shorts/pants. One of the great features of this shoe, and some other newer Diesel's are the honeycomb tread. It looks great and it actually is very comfortable/safe when driving a manual car. I bring driving up because where I live, the winters can be extremely snowy and icy, and other pairs of casual shoes I have are a little sketchy if they get wet and I start driving making me come to the point of being worried about my foot slipping off the pedals, but not with these.I would like to say this is my favorite pair of shoes, but every month I get a new pair of Diesel's and I keep being surprised at the quality and style of the newest pair I get, which is hardly a problem!Not only are these affordable, but they look great, feel great and get compliments almost every time I slip them on!

I have worn it almost daily for 6 months. As such, it has incurred some serious wear and tear as well as what most people would call abuse. The watch has broken on me twice, once when the band broke unexpectedly and once when I was swimming with it and the largest dial broke off and the face filled with water. I purchased through Nordstrom and each time they have replaced the watch free of charge. I am fairly sure that the manufacturers warranty would also have covered this, but no way it would have been as easy as simply walking into a Nordstrom and changing it out. Each time I went for a new one I was given the option of getting a different watch and I spent a great deal of time trying on several other Diesel models. Each time I chose to stick with the DZ4207. The face is also available for slightly less with a leather band that doesn't require the watch to be sized. I prefer the stainless steel linked band, but that's personal preference.Yes, the watch is BIG. It is definitely a good idea to try it on in person before purchasing. I have somewhat small wrists and the watch face takes up my entire wrist. Nevertheless, it grows on you. Some people ask if it is heavy, but after a minute of having it on I don't notice the weight.All in all, great watch. I love it.

Others are of crappy quality or are obscenely priced or mega-uncomfortable. I picked the raw steel (silver) with a black face because a)it's a classic b)doesn't have any plating to be scuffed off by friction, time or scratches -just pure stainless steel all over-and it's the cheapest of their line to boot !! I weighed it and it's 235 grs with all the links before resizing the band, which has the diameter to fit the paw of an elephant.Case and bracelet are extremely well machined, matter of fact this is THE best bracelet I've ever had on a watch, and I've had a lot !! Not only are the links extremely thick but smooth to the touch making the band extremely comfy to wear. The clasp has a single spring-loaded lock system and no security lock but clicks firmly in place and feels durable.Now to the watch itself : the design of the case is stunning; it's the only one in the market that can be worn on a 6 3/4  wrist like mine with no overhang of the lugs (yes I tried it at the mall first). Matter of fact the lugs are very short and curve down but very little away from the case for this purpose. Diameter is 50 mm (not 51-52 as advertised) but lug to lug it's just 55 so it will fit most wrists. Word of caution : on wide wrists the lugs may sit and dig on the flesh resulting in discomfort since they end below the line of the caseback. To my pleasant surprise the bezel is not only rotatable but unidirectional with a 120-click ratchet system as oppossed to fixed like stated on the description. The caseback is engraved with the Diesel mohawhk logo in big size.The watch features a functional chronograph in that it can measure laps of time, but the markings on the subdials are too many and lack a logical arrangement, which paired to the tiny size of the dials render the chrono function very difficult and impractical. On such a big-faced timepiece this is paradoxical to say the least. A minor annoyance to me since most of us buy these watches for the looks alone. I've had it for just a couple of days and it has stayed on the second. Bad quality movements may exhibit appreciable variations within just 24 hs. My wish is that it's equipped with a Miyota movement but in most cases the backcase would boast japanese movementon the backcase in capitals so I guess it just has a good chinese movement which aren't bad nowadays.The chrono buttons have a precise and firm engagement action with an audible click and the crown has the most precise operation I've seen on an analog quartz; minutes needle don't move when it's pressed in . I managed to set the time PERFECTLY at the very first try. Upper 24 hs subdial keeps in synch with the hour needle -displaying 24 hs. or military time if you call it that way- and has no relation to the stopwatch noror can be used as a GMT needle which would have been a nice touch. Lower subdial accumulates up to 60 secs and on the left dial minutes up to 30 are displayed.

This watch is a behemoth, which is typical of most watches in Diesel's product line. It is a watch that demands attention and rest assured, you will get it while wearing this watch. When I unboxed it, my jaw dropped at the sheer size. Diesel and Nixon are the reigning champs of the oversized watch industry, and this model is no exception. The color combination of brown leather and gunmetal colored steel really works well with this timepiece. The numerals on the face are a dark gray which provides a good contrast. Be aware that this watch is difficult to read in low light conditions, especially since the hands have no illumination. The ends of the hands have silver paint though, so that helps a good bit. This is a great casual watch that would look great with jeans, khakis, or other sport/casual wear but it is definitely not a dress watch. There is a functional chronograph as well, which is an added bonus for functionality. So far, I absolutely love this watch and it is already one of the favorites in my collection of watches, which now stands at 16 LOL.

However, I happened to nab these on Amazon at a significant discount, so I thought I'd give them a try.I'll admit, I'm a little finicky about the pants I buy.  I probably try on about twenty pairs of jeans for every pair I purchase.  Since I walk a lot and ride a bike around town a lot, I want the pants I buy to be made well and to fit well so they'll last.  I also want them to look good, but not overly trendy.  So if I find a pair I that fits the bill, I purchase them, and I wear them until they're completely worn out.Having had these for about 7 months, and worn them quite a bit, I have concluded that these might be the best jeans I've ever bought.  They are extremely comfortable, although they have to be worn and washed a few times to get that way (although, really, that's generally true of any pair of jeans).  I cannot over-emphasize how comfortable they are.  They fit perfectly, not too tight, not too loose, no bunching, and no chafing.  I've walked plenty of miles in them with no discomfort at all.They also feel light and breathable, but somehow they're still very sturdy.  I've had other jeans that were very comfortable, but wore out very quickly.  Not these - somehow they're comfortable but still very tough and durable.  Having worn and washed these probably something like 100 times (yes, I wear them all the time) in the past seven months, they still look factory new - no signs of wear, no loose threads or seams, no rips or snags, no problems at all. I have no doubt I'll be wearing these for years, and I'll be sad when they finally kick the bucket.  However, that looks to be quite a while in the future.As for stylishness, I'll be honest, I don't care for really flashy, super-trendy jeans. Yes, these are designer jeans, but they look fairly conservative, which suits my taste.  I prefer understated quality to avant-guard in the style department.In summary, these jeans are as close to perfect as anything I've bought.  I only wish I'd ordered four more pairs of them while the price was low.  Still, knowing what I know now, I'd buy them again at full price.

I got the small and find that the fit is perfect with the sleeves ending right at the wrists and the bottom of the jacket coming down to the belt line. I only have two gripes with this jacket: 1. The cut of the jacket, specifically around the top/outside of the shoulders and the bottom/armpit area are awkwardly constructed. When I put on the jacket and wear it, it looks fine, but the second I raise my arm above shoulder height, the jacket tightens up on the bottom and the top shoulders ruffle around and bunch up. This phenomenon is hard to explain but I think its due to the fact that the width of the shoulders is made with a lot of jacket material where as the armpit area is not. Since the ratio of material on top the shoulder vs. the armpit area is so huge, it feels like I could rip my jacket if I make any sudden drastic arm movements. 2. The collar is very rough against the neck. The label says this jacket is 100% nylon which may explain the faux/synthetic looking/feeling collar which borders the neck line of the jacket giving it a rough feeling on the neck.

I had tried them on and walked around the living room, packed them up and returned them and ordered a half size bigger replacement.  My replacement order arrived yesterday.  I tried them on and it's a perfect fit.  The shoes are very very comfortable, and soft which surprised me.  The sole is a bit thin, which I expected for shoes of this style, but I figure if it gets to be a problem, I'll get some Superfeet inserts.  I got those for my snowboard boots, even though the original sole was pretty comfortable, but the Superfeet were just a couple of levels better, and they were one of the best purchases I've ever made.  These shoes are so comfortable I'm planning on order another pair in a different color.  My advice, if this is your first time buying shoes online and you use the sizing chart, order a half size bigger, or just order the size you'd normally wear.  P.S. Getting the replacement pair was no issue at all.  I just went to the Returns section, and entered these were too small and ordered the half size bigger pair.

The style of these looks great. They make me more motivated to keep improving my body because these are not meant to complement a figure that's not athletic.I have noticed these are a little too small in the manhood area for me, so they do feel just a bit tight down there and there are small windows of visibility located at the groin.  So If I am wearing these with shorts and stretching and someone happens to be looking exactly at those two areas, they will see the part of the &#34;gift wrap&#34; covering the sides of my jewels.

This makes it difficult to find stylish shoes that can encompass the enlargement of the bone that has occurred at the base of my right big toe.  Sigh.  I can't even stand to say the word, \"bunion\", so you might imagine how I felt about trying to wear \"sensible shoes\" LOL!Diesel to the rescue...I love the Diesel brand and their ultra cool italian style sensibilities.  I wear their jeans, which fit like they were made for me, and last forever, and I also have had many, many shoes from the Diesel line that I have loved and worn to death.  So I was very happy to find these shoes, which have plenty of room in the area across the toe to encompass the slight to moderate enlargement of that area of the bone on my right foot.  I keep the shoes loose in that area, flexing my foot when lacing them so that I have plenty of wiggle room so that the bone doesn't become compressed and cause me pain and suffering while strutting with style.I have found these shoes to be very resilient clean-wise.  I even knocked an oil lamp off a table in my foyer, causing it to break and splatter oil EVERYWHERE, including on a pair of these shoes.  I simply took a hot wet washcloth and soaped it up with dishwashing liquid, and proceeded to clean the surface of these shoes until they looked great again.  They were the Black Night/Black style, and I couldn't believe that they cleaned up so well.I love these shoes so much that I actually own the aforementioned style, as well as the Black Multi, and Bungee Cord/Black/Brown.  In addition, I've bought them in the Raketier style, which is just the same exact shoe with smooth leather accents instead of suede in the Dress Blues/Classic and Bungee Cord/Latigo Bay/Coffee Bean, which I paid way too much for at right about $125, but they are my favorite pair.

He took off the neat watch he had on; put on the new acquisition and declared he had the plane ride to Phoenix to get familiar with the watch. We can call him The Deisel Man now. So it eas a great success and everybody wore a warm glow... as other reviews say, now that you know all about the size just keep this fascinating watch in mind as a gift for them; they will love it and I think you are especially bold and a risk-taker- ehile being so ingenious.

I'm not too big on the \"fancy watches\" with all the nonsense dials, in which i'm sure the majority of the people that buy them don't know how to read them, or even try. (just an opinion, to each their own though.)This watch is perfect for someone who wants a really nice, but yet a simple watch.It looks much nicer in person as well, the black finish is great, and looks good with pretty much all clothing. I can't really comment on the durability considering i haven't had it for too long, but it feels like very high quality. The metal, glass, and the leather band all feel great.Pros:Elegant looking. from the dials, matte-metal finish, leather band, etc.Nice weight to it.Doesn't feel, or look cheap what-so-ever, but also doesn't look like a \"try hard\" watch.Branding isn't obnoxious.The leather box it came in is even nice? lolCons:Doesn't glow in the dark (minor con, i guess).Leather band replacements are half the price of the watch (about $25-$35).

I have other Diesel shoes that have held up pretty well, so I expect to have these for a long time.UPDATE:  I have had these shoes over a year now and the tips of them have peeled off quite a bit, so I used shoe glue to fix them.  This would make me give them 4.5 stars instead of 5, but I'm rounding up and keeping the 5 rating.  I expect the shoe glue will keep them in good shape for a while.

Based on this, I was willing to give these a shot and bought them online.  However, I was very disappointed with what arrived.  The quality of leather used was much lighter than what I expected.  Granted, I was looking for a fashion alternative to combat boots - and did expect them to not be as rugged as traditional combat boots, but this was much lighter construction than what I'd even expected.  Additionally the zippers on the outside of the boot turned out to be more difficult to deal with than traditional jump boot zippers located on the inside.  I'm not sure why Diesel elected to put the zippers there, but from an ergonomics and  convenience standpoint, their choice is flawed.  The biggest flaw in the construction however are the lace hooks.  First, they are made of cheap pot metal that bends when you put stress on them ...like when you lace up the boots!  If the hooks bend out just from the stress of the boots being worn - something is wrong.  Second, one of the hooks actually just pulled right out of the leather.  The rivet section holding the hook in place is far too small and the leather is far too lightweight to do the job.  This was the tipping point for me ...to pay that kind of money and get that kind of quality was shocking.  So i returned these Diesel boots and will not go back to that brand.  I did find exactly what I wanted however in the GBX Bould.

Normally this might be an unwelcome development but the comments come mostly from attractive young women so while I'm not saying that these shoes make me a chick-magnet, they do however attract attention from a demographic that is fun to talk with, even if the topic never goes beyond shoes.They make me look a little more casual with black pants, a sort of hipster-bohemian chic, although hipsterism is vastly over-rated, I already spoke of the social benefits of these shoes, and the aesthetic lies in the eyes of those who behold and/or wear them.The shoes are slightly comfortable though I cannot imagine anyone wearing these shoes without some sort of insert-able insole  I use a gel insert and suddenly they are nice and lush and soft inside.  The shoes are not made for comfort or distance, but can be made comfortable despite themselves.  Your actual mileage may vary depending on the tenacity of your feet.A good looking shoe. Unusual. Somewhat eye-catching.  Set yourself apart.  Stop trying to be an individual for goodness sake, capitulate to your inner Imelda Marcos!

They didn't have my size in the pair I wanted, I came to Amazon and placed this order.  The jeans were absolutely gorgeous, a bit too small in the waist, but I knew I could exchange them.  Unfortunately, I checked out the inner tag of the waist and discovered they were fake.

So as pretty as they were, I returned them instead of an exchange.  I then went to Diesel's official online store and they were having a 30% off Spring special so I ordered some there, knowing there would be no issues of authenticity.  I get the jeans and guess what?  Same thing.  No microstitching, no numbers over the indian head, made in Tunisia.  So for any of those using any of those examples to confirm a authenticity...don't!!  Apparently that is false information.

Funny enough, not only did I buy that pair because I freaking loved them the second I pulled them on, but I bought a pair just like them at the Santa Monica Diesel store in Dec. 2009 - I thought it was a good idea to have two pairs of the same. Subsequently, I lost 20 pounds so the 32x30's don't fit any more. When I switched to 31x30 I ordered them through Amazon and they fit as expected - didn't need to go to my Diesel store in Chicago and worry about taxes and commute time. Again after losing additional weight I moved down to the 30x30 and ordered online....they fit perfect and look great. If any of you are reading this you're probably annoyed but are seeing a common theme - you can expect a great fit and a great look no matter where you order these from. In other words, Diesel makes a consistent product and I've since purchased a different jean from them called New Fanker. A little bit of a step away from the Zathan but again, good look- good fit.

The Nixon is rated 30 bars vs Diesel's 5 bars but since I am not going to use this watch to go scuba diving I am saving about $300.So, look no further for an awesome big gold watch - you won't regret it.Update: I just purchased the Nixon - 51-30 Chrono - All Gold and that is the ultimate gold bling watch. Although, this watch is incredible at half the price. Nixon is an actual divers watch and this watch is a fashion watch. Both are awesome, although the Nixon is the bomb.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Big, Bad, Bold, Gold", "unixReviewTime": 1354060800, "reviewTime": "11 28, 2012"}, "B008BTS6W6.A32FBLOPNKAFS": {"reviewerID": "A32FBLOPNKAFS", "asin": "B008BTS6W6", "reviewerName": "FaM3", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "if you want people to be looking at your wrist this is the watch to get. its really big and shiny and it gets a lot of attention. i love it", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "big watch!", "unixReviewTime": 1396483200, "reviewTime": "04 3, 2014"}, "B008BTS6W6.A3EILYS1L9JZZX": {"reviewerID": "A3EILYS1L9JZZX", "asin": "B008BTS6W6", "reviewerName": "George Eady", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewText": "Very nice watch I get a lot of compliments when I wear it.

Starting with the design, it is clean and simple, but has a chunky feel to it, which is nice. Then the gold just sends it up to a high note. It looks better in person than it does in pictures because of how reflective it is. It is quite large, but not too large compared to some of the other Diesels. With that, it is about as heavy as you would expect. Not feather light or lead heavy, but a hefty few ounces. The timepiece and chronograph work well, but is that really the reason you buy this watch? Not really, but they are effective and clear to read (glow in the dark hour and minute hands), which makes it great for wearing at night. Overall, the watch looks great and performs at a high quality standard. Good buy.But seriously, this watch has gained me so many compliments in so many places. Random people come up to me all the time and tell me how awesome this watch is. I thought for a long time about buying this watch before I did, wondering if it would be too bold, but I have received nothing but positive feedback.

I hang/air dry only.IF you are a skinny guy, with a shorter torso than leg length, I promise you you will look sexy as hell in these. I'm just being honest- every girl I've dated has complimented them. The low rise is low, but it will mitigate the long legs by sitting lower.

I thought I was buying a rich, brown on the red end of the scale... I didn't spend much (well, any) time researching other than already knowing this jacket is 2x the price being asked and is a current jacket (this season). I read a couple reviews that mentioned color and thought perhaps an interpretation of the reviewers. I received mine a couple days ago and it is not brown - it is called &#34;dark olive&#34;. Visit Diesel's Ireland (IE) site (store dot diesel dot com slash IE) and look under jackets - you'll see the actual color. Mine is a little darker with a little more brown than the picture on the IE site... color variation to be expected by design but not from Amazon's picture to the actual color... Amazon must have gotten their brown picture from a time when a brown color option was available BUT as a luxury designer, when Diesel runs out of a seasonal item, it's out - the majority they don't make more.Great quality leather with manual hand process that will make each jacket unique (ish) - there isn't as much variation to the Lagnum as the L-BHAL for example - when I picked up my L-BHAL I had a few to choose from and each was very unique due to the design whereas the Lagnum is a more consistent color. HOWEVER, if you receive one that has imperfections, this is by Diesel design to have unique articles (primarily certain denim and leather jackets). Personally, I wouldn't mark it down for designed-in uniqueness.In the end, this jacket is very soft, semi-body conscious, and looks great. It isn't too heavy. I have the XXL and it fits fine - 6'2&#34;, 230lb (solid - the weight is muscular from years of time in the gym). It is tight on my arms, shoulders and chest - anything is in XXL though...

I took quick trip to the mall and everyone from the salesfolks at the high-end jewelers to random folks in a clothing store wanted a look.A few comments:- This watch is big (51mm x 60mm), but not so big that it looks like you are carrying Big Ben on your arm like the Diesel Big Daddy.  To know if it will fit well: put your arm on a piece of paper and use a pencil to draw a line on either side of your wrist.  If the lines are less than 60mm apart then it it is probably too large since it will stick off the sides.- The face is all gray -- that means it is hard to read in anything but bright light and even in afternoon sun it takes a second to find the hands.  You're not wearing this watch to tell the time though, are you?  The diamond pattern on the face catches the light in neat ways and the little screwheads scattered about the face are great details.- I wouldn't call it a durable watch.  The crystal is super thin and sits slightly above the bezel. I imagine an accidental whack against a door jam could cause some damage.- This is an inexpensive watch, so the fit and finish isn't perfect.  If you look carefully you can see grind marks on the crystal edges and imperfections here and there.  But ... if someone is looking that hard at the watch they have way too much time on their hands or you're not entertaining them enough.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Big and beautiful", "unixReviewTime": 1354147200, "reviewTime": "11 29, 2012"}, "B008MXNSWE.A163PO05HSVK69": {"reviewerID": "A163PO05HSVK69", "asin": "B008MXNSWE", "reviewerName": "Mandajane", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "I bought this for my husband, and he absolutely loves it!

DZ7257 (quartz movt., AR-coated mineral crystal, black leather strap, black PVD coating on case) is one of my favorite fashion watches.  While I own a few high-end brands (Rolex, Omega and Hublot), this watch fills a gap in a watch that is relatively inexpensive, looks good and wears well in a casual style.  The watch is quite large.  However, it wears quite well and it is comfortable.  It is fairly light on the wrist as well.  Because there is no distinctive color on the hands - and because the dial is off-set - it takes a few seconds to search out the time.  Perhaps, if the hands were colored differently, it would be more legible.  The leather strap is of very good quality as is the buckle and excess strap keeper.  An impressive feature is the fact that the strap is attached to the lugs via a substantially large screws and NOT the usual spring bars.  This area is typically the weakest part of the watch and it is where it will usually fail should the watch get caught on something.  In this case, this area is quite strong.  The anti-reflective coating on the inside of the watch crystal give it its distinctive \"bluish\" tint and it a neat feature that makes this watch stand out.  Finally, this watch features a large mineral crystal.  I am normally biased towards crystals and prefer \"tried-and-true\" synthetic sapphire.  However, mineral crystal has a very good impact resistant quality about it that I benefited from just last week when I dropped this watch on my tile bathroom floor - crystal down - and nothing happened to it.  I am very positive that synthetic sapphire would have sustained damage.  This watch also features a nice GMT function that is set via the crown at the 9 o'clock position.  Essentially, you put the other timezone there and it will represent the additional hour difference.  It is interesting that it does so at 30 minute increments so that you can even set weird time zones (like Kabul, Afghanistan, for example).  So, overall, this is a neat watch and its worth the price if you can get it at around $200 - $250.  In some rare cases, I have seen it for $169.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Amazing watch for the price!", "unixReviewTime": 1356739200, "reviewTime": "12 29, 2012"}, "B008MXNXP6.A10YL1KGHJI0KD": {"reviewerID": "A10YL1KGHJI0KD", "asin": "B008MXNXP6", "reviewerName": "Kelly E Motley", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "This watch it amazing!

The 9 was too long and slipped at my heel w/every step; the 8.5 absolutely squashes my toes! I have a pretty easy-to-fit foot so I have no idea why there's such a stark difference just between half sizes. I ultimately returned the 9 since even with a thick sock they swallowed me. As far as width, they feel like a standard 'M' (B).My biggest gripe was how inconsistent the denim treatment was between the two pair. The pair I had to return was nearly identical to the online image--a cool black faded denim, even toned. The denim on the other pair is super splotchy w/way too much white. Think: early 90s acid wash jeans. Not a good look. The jet black laces just exacerbate all the white, uneven splotches.However, the stud/screw details are up to par. It's edgy without screaming STUDS! They're applied securely and placed just right.There's a little cushion in the footbed; compared to some Chucks and Betsey Johnson hi-tops I own, I'd say they're better designed for comfort...should they actually fit well.The rubber that surrounds Exposure is a nice matte black; the outsole is quality.I can't claim this shoe fits TTS, it's a crap shoot with the denim treatment, and I think they're a wee bit overpriced.

I got the same size, almost the exactly the same style, they were Prime eligible...perfect, easy, and a great price for these IMO.I'm not a skinny jeans kind of guy, I'd say these are a tad tighter of a style than I'm used to, but very comfortable and the ladies in the office can't stop commenting on them, my wife loves them too.I bought a 33 waist, 32 leg - waist seems spot on with Diesel, but a 32 length seems more like a 34 on most other brands...so my normal 32X34 from American Eagle turns into a 33X32 with Diesel (if that helps).Great quality overall, great look, I would highly recommend.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "I Really Love These Jeans...And I Hate Clothes", "unixReviewTime": 1355788800, "reviewTime": "12 18, 2012"}, "B009OXI4WA.A3TJ0J9518R49I": {"reviewerID": "A3TJ0J9518R49I", "asin": "B009OXI4WA", "reviewerName": "Junjie Bao", "helpful": [2, 2], "reviewText": "the Jeans I have got is way to big for a size 31.

I am typically not fond of Diesel watches as they are generally over-sized and unnecessarily busy looking despite offering minimal features.  In addition, like many other fashion brands that offer watches like Armani, Burberry, and Michael Kors; Diesel watches are made by Fossil.  While there is nothing wrong with Fossil watches, I am not keen on purchasing a Fossil watch with a \"luxiurious\" fashion brand name as you are literally paying a premium for the name alone.Considering the significant discount on the watch at the time of purchase, I made an exception to my above sentiments.  Now on to the particulars of the watch...The watch sports a very clean design, which is particularly rare for Diesel watches. Everything from the brushed silver-tone hour and minute hands which match the silver-tone bezel to the monochromatic dial add to the classic look of the watch.  Subtle features like the over-sized crown and the yellow second hand provide enough visual interest to make it contemporary.The 44 millimeter case diameter and 10 millimeter thickness is my go-to specs for sizing and a very proportionate size for most wrists in my opinion.  The distressed calfskin band looks well made, but the watch is only a couple months old and has yet to stand the test of time.Overall, I am very pleased with the watch and would recommend it to anyone that finds the aesthetics as pleasing as I do.  Again, it is manufactured by Fossil, so don't expect anything more than you would from a Fossil watch in terms of build quality.

Got a size 12 in these and they're super snug unless I go sockless but who does that. What's more important though is the upper is not made of just leather and suede. I've never encountered shoes made with what looks like a poly sheet on top so I just automatically assumed the materials based on the pictures were leather/suede. However, the vamp and the sides actually are this synthetic polyester-looking material which cheapens the overall look of the shoe. I got this on a lightning deal so for $40, it's passable.

I will be honest. I've been working out for quite some time and the results are starting to show nicely. So when I go to the beach I want to show off. Yes I said it. So what better way to do that than some short, bright red, fashion designer swim shorts? A couple of my lady friends loved them so, I daresay they are eye catchers to say the least. I own these in addition to the equally short Diesel Barrely swim shorts and I really enjoy walking around in this bad boy. Few things will make you feel as confident than strutting around in just enough clothing to cover what matters and knowing you look darn good doing it.Now that my egocentric rant is over, Diesel makes high quality clothing no doubt about that. There are no flaws whatsoever in the shorts. No rips or tears, the stitching is great, and the details are subtle, but well done. The fabric is a nice nylon that follows the countour of the body very nicely, especially if you work out your legs (which I DO, 205 pound squats ladies and gentlemen), but doesn't cling. There are two side pockets, and a back pocket outlined by silver trim with a silver metal accent hanging from the zipper. Again, subtle, but nice. The shorts read \"Diesel, Take a Ride on the Freaky Side\" on the back. No comma, granted. That's kind of a funny statement, I have yet to whip that one out on a beach girl, but I'm sure the opportunity will present itself in the future.These are great shorts if, like me, you've been feeling good about your physique and want to work it a little bit, as much as a guy can work it I guess. I make no apologies for that choice of words. A note though, these go by European sizes. I am normally a 30\" waist on US sizes but I was a 28\" with these shorts and even then I wish they were maybe a quarter of an inch slimmmer in the waist.So, if you're feeling ballsy, order, and have fun!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "High Quality, Bold Swim Shorts", "unixReviewTime": 1380240000, "reviewTime": "09 27, 2013"}, "B00BBJUST2.A1S7FFSPNGM76S": {"reviewerID": "A1S7FFSPNGM76S", "asin": "B00BBJUST2", "reviewerName": "TURKY", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "A charming watch to have and to be gifted as well.Million stars product.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Five Stars", "unixReviewTime": 1404345600, "reviewTime": "07 3, 2014"}, "B00BBM65UK.A89VXW6T4LH52": {"reviewerID": "A89VXW6T4LH52", "asin": "B00BBM65UK", "reviewerName": "Dan", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "While rather large and somewhat obnoxious I have to be thrilled with it every time I bother to look down at my wrist for it gives me the chance to scoff at smaller watches and turn up my nose and say definitively, for once, &#34;Mine is Bigger.&#34;", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A Fantastic Watch", "unixReviewTime": 1393977600, "reviewTime": "03 5, 2014"}, "B00BBM65UK.A1ZLYJHKTOBL4R": {"reviewerID": "A1ZLYJHKTOBL4R", "asin": "B00BBM65UK", "reviewerName": "Justin H.", "helpful": [2, 3], "reviewText": "I love the looks of this watch but the drawback for me is that it does not have a sapphire crystal window to resist scratches.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "decent watch", "unixReviewTime": 1387324800, "reviewTime": "12 18, 2013"}, "B00BBM65UK.A1IGTY7AYSG6A5": {"reviewerID": "A1IGTY7AYSG6A5", "asin": "B00BBM65UK", "reviewerName": "lee king", "helpful": [0, 3], "reviewText": "Hubcaps are out dated and so is Flavor Flav size watches.

Why? Because designer fits so much better than a cheap pair of board shorts from a superstore; more often than not it's like wearing a boat sail around your waist. The amount of excess material is just insanity.Diesel's Kroobeach Board Short is another example of the high quality, well fitting clothing Diesel makes. What's even better is catching deal on Amazon where you can acquire designer items without burning a hole in your pocket. Actually in most cases with designer prices, taking a flamethrower to your pants. Or wherever your house your wallet. The shorts look exactly how is pictured, perhaps a little looser closer to the knee for me as I am still working on bulking up my legs in my weight-lifting. If I had to sum the fit up in a single statement it would be just enough material. Not baggy, but not tight. A reviewer seems to be unaware that these come in a Size 28 which I recommend getting if you are normally arounda 30\" waist in American sizes.The fabric feels a little thinner than swimsuits I've had in the past but honestly thinner doesn't mean lower quality. Diesel is well known for making superior fabrics in their items and I feel the Kroobeach is no exception; the shorts are very well-made from the fabric to the stitching and I have no doubt they will last for a long time. Aesthetically, there's the belt loops (just for show), back pockets and a button front which is a nice change from a drawstring. As far as the pockets go, I wouldn't expect them to function too well. Diesel was obviously shooting for the look of actually wearing some type of shorts which is kind of cool in my opinion. Other than that there's not much more to review than what you can't already see. As far as board shorts go these are pretty \"no-frills\".These are great board shorts.

I've compared this to online size charts at diesel.com and can only guess Diesel uses non-standard sizing, at least on these boots.Needless to say, I haven't been too concerned about the size discrepancy because a boot is secured around your ankle and lower leg, not just the foot. One size smaller might provide a better fit (it's hard to tell), but a boot won't drop off your foot and as the width is fine, I've had no issues with blistering.The sole is largely leather with a bit of textile in the heel for durability. I'd recommend getting a topy applied by a cobbler after you wear in the boots. This should cover a lot of the leather sole, providing some protection from wear and the elements.The best part of these boots is the zip - you only need to tie the laces once, and the convenience of donning and doffing with a quick zip is great. One small negative is that I expected the boots to have more of a 'dressy' appearance than they actually do, but in black they are still smart enough to wear at the office.

The black color on the bottom sole will come off once you walk outside, however this isn't a huge deal. The zippers are a bit stiff- I had to lubricate mine with wax, not to mention one zipper is a bit defective and gets stuck here and there. Had to use a pliers to zip it back, but I received a discount for this as It was defective, but still useable.

As you probably know, it's very important to look cool at that age. I was afraid he wouldn't like them, but they look much better in real life than online. Very masculine boots that are versatile. They look like a high end leather athletic shoe if you wear your jeans over the boot. If you tuck your jeans into the boot it adds a masculine sense of style.  These are made of very nice leather, they are cool because they are both rugged and athletic looking.  As far as sizing, just loosen the laces a bit before unzipping and trying them on, they fit true to size in my opinion.  However, if you have a very  wide foot you may want to go a half size up from your normal size.  I like how they look with the &#34;skinnier&#34; jeans that are in style now, they add that missing touch, but in a very masculine way.

Contrary to what many have stated here, they do not run small at all.  I watched a youtube video review and the reviewer gave some great tips on how to get these on and off, I followed his instructions and they are easier to take on and off than many of my other boots.  And a note about the size;  I normally wear a size 9.  In most dress shoes I have to go up to a size 9.5 so they will fit my slightly wide feet, so I ordered a 9.5 in these since many were saying they ran a tad small.  The 9.5's fit me perfectly!Build Quality:  They are very light weight and the zipper feels a bit cheap, but I hope by following the suggestions I received to always make sure they are not laced up so tight it puts pressure on the zipper, they will last a very long time.  If the zipper fails early, I'll update this review.  The laces &#34;feel&#34; cheap, but I suspect it's due to the style, they are very light and FLAT laces with a coating on them.  Again, if they prove to fail on me earlier than they should I'll update.Looks:  They look amazing!  Love these boots, they moved up to my favorite footwear instantly as soon as I pulled them out of the box.Comfort:  From putting them on and walking around the house, they feel like a pair of sneakers or deck shoes.  Good arch support but not a whole lot of cushioning.  I'm not sure how they will feel walking around in them all day since the padding is much less than my other boots, but as mentioned above, I'll update if there are any issues.  The leather is very soft, so I don't think there will be much breaking in needed, they are very comfortable right out of the box.For the price I paid (about half price through Amazon.com) these are an exceptional buy.

First off this is only my observation and opinion; I probably wouldn't have given a review in order to keep this product under wraps, because its that good!!!, I wanted to keep this a secret and not tell anyone about it. But how else would the company know if its good or not, so that they could make more of these kind. The comfort is amazing, because the material/fabric is absolutely amazing, smooth, soft and very silk like and stretchy, but just snug enough to hold everything in place. And the best thing is that it doesn't have that ugly CONTOUR LINE in the front pouch, which is very uncomfortable and which is one of the biggest errors a lot of other companies make. I hope that other underwear companies change that and follow this as an example. Again the fabric is awesome, but they could have made the elastic on the waist a bit wider and stronger, but over all this product is amazing.

These Diesel Microfiber Briefs might be the most comfortable things to ever have encased my boys. They are well made, comfortable, very well priced especially for Diesel, and are stylish to boot for activities in which pants are not necessarily a necessity. Try saying THAT five times fast.For those who don't know, Diesel is a European fashion clothing company renown for their high quality, well-fitting clothing; jeans especially. This quality and fit comes at a premium however and most items of Diesel clothing will make your wallet cringe in fear. So considering each of these pairs of briefs are about $14 apiece, that is a steal. Now you might be thinking &#34;Well okay, but for that money I can get multiple pairs of Hanes at Target or something.&#34; To which I say shame on you. Treat your equipment with some respect okay? For pity's sake.Diesel made the Blade Microfiber Brief with every once of quality the company is known for. The Microfiber material is very soft and lovely to the touch and no I don't mean with your fingers. The material stretches very well and doesn't feel like the threads will come loose, the fabric will be damaged, or that the waistband will fray, nothing like that. These are very well made briefs. So while yes each one comes with some premium, you get your money's worth.The fit is also spectacular. I have a pretty small waistline so a small was the go-to choice. I ordered seven colors and every single one fits perfectly. The briefs are not too tight, but not too loose, and I think have a bit of a low-rise. The only complaint I have with the fit is that the waistband feels like it could use slightly more cinching but the briefs don't slide down or ride up (briefs in general don't really do this due to the lack of material that can ride up your leg which is why I like them so much) so I can't really, nor want to, dock any stars off for that. These briefs also have the the fly opening for when nature calls. This is a nice touch; many briefs don't have this so more points to Diesel on that one.Gentlemen, quality underwear matters. Don't buy the cheap stuff just to have something. Spend some money and build up a nice underwear drawer you'll be looking forward to wearing and wearing in front of the ladies when, not if, when that crucial time comes. Your junk and your confidence will both thank your brain and your wallet.

This makes it difficult to find stylish shoes that can encompass the enlargement of the bone that has occurred at the base of my right big toe. Sigh. I can't even stand to say the word, &#34;bunion&#34;, so you might imagine how I felt about trying to wear &#34;sensible shoes&#34; LOL!Diesel to the rescue...I love the Diesel brand and their ultra cool italian style sensibilities. I wear their jeans, which fit like they were made for me, and last forever, and I also have had many, many shoes from the Diesel line that I have loved and worn to death. So I was very happy to find these shoes, which have plenty of room in the area across the toe to encompass the slight to moderate enlargement of that area of the bone on my right foot. I keep the shoes loose in that area, flexing my foot when lacing them so that I have plenty of wiggle room so that the bone doesn't become compressed and cause me pain and suffering while strutting with style.I love these shoes so much that I actually own them in Dress Blues/Classic and Bungee Cord/Latigo Bay/Coffee Bean, which I paid way too much for at right about $125, but they are my favorite pair. In addition, I've bought them in the Aramis style, which is just the same exact shoe with suede leather accents instead of the smooth leather of the Raquetier in Black Night/Black, Black Multi, and Bungee Cord/Black/Brown.  The colors are different enough that I don't think anyone would notice that they are the same style--every pair is quite unique. I absolutely LOVE these shoes!!I have found these shoes to be very resilient clean-wise. I even knocked an oil lamp off a table in my foyer, causing it to break and splatter oil EVERYWHERE, including on one of the pairs of the Aramis shoes--the Black Night/Black ones. I simply took a hot wet washcloth and soaped it up with dishwashing liquid, and proceeded to clean the surface of these shoes until they looked great again.

I was a little wrong, as the shirt is a little big for him, but the good news is that it'll probably fit him until he's 6 yrs old. As far as the shirt goes, the material is of good quality, isn't too thin, has not shrunk (he's worn this 3 times in 6 days, and after 3 washes, is still the same size), and the design is nicely printed. It has a bit of a vintage element to the design, purposefully a little faded, and looks really cool.

I know if they stretch out too much I can wash them and tighten them up.  But not necessary -  33/30 is a snug fit and as I have been wearing them they are stretching out ever so slightly as I wished.  I'm not a slim fit person normally and these jeans have just the right amount of room for error.  They are stretching out just fine and fit me snug but comfortably.  I give a damp towel wash to freshen them up and know that once they are properly broken in I can hand wash in cool water to get them just right.  So don't be afraid to order 33/30 if are normally a 34/30 and find those stretch out too much overtiime.  Wear them over and over unitl broken in properly.  remember no elastine in this wash so be patient and wear them all the time so they stretch out just right for you.  Do not over size these there is room for error and in time will fit you just right.  I was nervous about going to a 33 vs 34 waist but they do in fact fit me just right.

I presume will be fine over a cashmere sweater down to about 25 degrees. I highly doubt it's good in temps below 20 degrees F. I have a super bulky Moncler puffer that kept me warm at 6 degrees F last week.

I know most people do not consider &#34;normal&#34; to spend 200-300 bucks in a pair of jeans.

When I bought my first Diesel jeans I began using Safados, but these jeans have a very skinny fit and I have reasonably thick thighs (I ride my bicycle everyday), so I changed into a more &#34;relaxed&#34; style and I started buying Belthers and Darrons, which are still skinny fit jeans but not that skinny around the thighs.Bottom line, I received these jeans and I immediately fell in love with them from the moment I put my eyes on them. However, surprisingly these jeans somehow have a &#34;Safado&#34; fit (i.e. they have a very skinny fit around the thighs).I am not returning these 'cause I really liked them, but it did made me unhappy to see that these Belthers did not have the type of fit I am used to.In the overall, if you do not have the same issue I do with my thighs, do not hesitate to buy these jeans.

Personally I don't think a man should look like a carrot, but that's not what fashion designers think as everything today is tight and the leg opennings are tiny small.So if you just want to look like a MAN, but still owning jeans which look much better and stylish than any 50$ un-branded one, I think the Waykee worth the price, as it really looks super cool.Diesel's former 'Straight' fit (larkee) was too 'relaxed' for me, I think the new Waykee fit is much sexier and looks better.

The Safado is one of my favorite cuts ever, however; it is for a specific body type and depends on what one looks for in jeans.  I'm 6-1 and fit.  I have long legs.  These pants fit great.  They have enough stretch that they never pull.  They have enough that they don't stretch out after a few hours and not fit.  I've worn them several days without a belt and it was only after six or seven days of wearing that I needed a belt.  This is key for me with jeans.  These fit medium to low and lower as one wears them between washings.  The fit is tight in the thighs and them tapers from the knee.  The bottom is a slimmer opening which I love.  They look better as one wears them between washings.  I wash them as little as possible and I highly suggest washing them on gentle cycle in addtion to cold and inside out.  I've thrown them in the sink with woolite and prefer to do that were it not for time constraints.My one issue with Diesel is that it is not necessarily made in Italy anymore.  Nothing beats a good pair of pants made in Italy.  They started making them in Romania and the fit was a bit different, in general, with all Diesel.  I'm glad they are still made in the EU.  I hated seeing these go outside of Italy.  However, once I learned the newer fits, the Romanian made Diesel was still pretty good.  Now I see these are being made in Morocco. I fear the fit is going to be different and the quality not as it was.  This being said, I do not know.These are great jeans if you are looking for something a big snug but stretchy.  They tend to fit tighter in the thigh area than the waist and a lot of people have problems with that.  I personally like it.  They feel great out of the box.  I have had several pair and do the most to not wear them in as they are already designed to be such.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great cut of Jeans Overall, Is the quality still there?", "unixReviewTime": 1403568000, "reviewTime": "06 24, 2014"}, "B00JRQQFQ6.A3VCMUUO1G4IZG": {"reviewerID": "A3VCMUUO1G4IZG", "asin": "B00JRQQFQ6", "reviewerName": "MyBlueMoon", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewText": "You know these are solid jeans before you even open the sealed black plastic bag.  When they arrived, I was surprised by how heavy the bag felt for jeans.  Even though these are distressed jeans you don't fear these ripping anytime soon.  They are heavy and strong.To help people get the right sizing, I will add my comments.  These are slim jeans but not skinny jeans.I wear size 33/32 for every type of pants.  In almost every case, the fit is perfect around the wait with dress pants always staying the same and jeans giving a little (stretching).  I end up needing a belt after awhile, but I like belts for fashion sense anyway.  These jeans were exactly the same for waist size.  A perfect fit right out of the bag.  The length was another story.  I guess it is &#34;in&#34; to wear slim jeans with the bottom of the pants rolled up once or twice, and with these, you would have ample space.  I would say that these are more like 33/34 and that is ok with me but if these were dress pants they would be going back.  For anyone who has the same fit for all their pants, 33/32 in my case - I would probably want 33/31 and I highly doubt that is a size option.  33/30 would probably be a perfect fit just touching the tops of my shoes...  that is how much extra length is available in these pants.  I am an older guy and I don't want to roll up the bottom of my pants and I can manage.  These are low riding on the hips and tighter in the thighs just as expected.  If you have a slimmer figure with bigger thighs like me, they have a nice tight fit in the thighs and getting looser from the knees down with a tighter fit at the ankles.  If you know you size, I would definitely think twice about the length unless you want to fold these up at the bottom.Great quality, thick and strong, great distressed look and fit.

My review is for the DZ4323, which is what is pictured here.Before getting into the horrible technical design of this watch I must say that this is by far the coolest watch I've ever seen (in terms of pure looks).  It looks far better in person than it does in the picture, the blue almost glows, very cool.  But, whoever designed the &#34;tick marks&#34; on this watch is a complete idiot.First, the 1/10 second sub-dial has 12 TICKS!!  TWELVE!!!  It should obviously have 10 because it is supposed to be measuring in 1/10 of a second, not 1/12.  The designer obviously just used the same sub-dials as the second and minute ones without even thinking about it.  What a moron.  Since every 1/2 rotation of the 1/10 second sub-dial is 1 second, each tick is 0.16666 of a second instead of 0.1.  I'm not going to get into the math you have to do to calculate 1/10 of a second with this watch, but it's annoying (easy, but should be unnecessary).Second, instead of having 4 ticks in between each hour mark (making for 60 ticks all the way around, 1 for each second) it has 7!!!  WHY SEVEN?!  I could understand 9, making each tick a half of a second, but SEVEN?!  This makes the second hand completely useless for telling time, and means that the second hand will never land directly on a tick.  Because of this, you can't use the ticks to tell how many seconds have elapsed on the current minute.Like I said, this is an absolutely gorgeous watch, a true sight for sore eyes, but is completely useless for telling time if you want to measure in anything smaller than minutes.  Seriously Diesel, this is just embarrassing.
