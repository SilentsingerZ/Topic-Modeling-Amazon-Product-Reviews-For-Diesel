What a neat design concept!Though I've usually preferred round-face watches, I'm really liking this large square-cut \"in depth\" black dial that contrasts with the steel hour and minute indicators and a neat yellow second hand.Lately, Iv'e been rolling up my sleeves a couple of laps just to see and be seen in this Diesel.

{"review": "B000N7X98K So, I've been looking to replace my Timex sports watch with something that doesn't have velcro that snags on everything, or irritating plastic bands that chafe, or metal bands that rip out your arm hair. I was surprised to find an instruction manual as large as the one this came with given that all the reviewers have said it doesn't include instructions for this particular watch. Thankfully they posted the instructions themselves and actually setting the watch is fairly easy. The face is pretty dim and hard to read without the light, and the lines on the face can obscure parts of the face at certain angles. Also, for some reason when you set the date it puts the day before the month, and that's just weird. It's kinda bulky, which is understandable since this is a men's watch and I had to poke a couple extra holes in so that it would fit me, but I don't think that's any excuse for the buckle digging into my wrist.Ended up finding a Timex watch with a metal band that could be replaced with a leather band. Stylish, comfy, not hard to read, and simple instructions that are pretty consistent between watches. And it was way cheaper.

{"review": "B000R4BCC4 These shoes are beautiful and both of the other reviewers gave them 5 stars BUT...  When I read the reviews I was disappointed about the lack of useful information because while I am happy to learn that someone thinks her legs look great in the shoes I am more interested in how the shoes fit.Even though I am JUST on the sane side of being a total shoe freak, I'd never heard of Diesel shoes so I had no idea about the sizing. I normally wear 8 1/2 to a 9 in pumps, depending on the brand, but these jumped from 9 to 10 so I ordered the 10.  A 9 1/2 would have been a perfect fit and I believe a 9 would have been agony! As it is, a gel insole will take care of the excess wiggle room and just make a comfortable shoe even more so.  The company put some thought into comfort as well as beauty because there is extra cushioning in the heel as well as the ball of the foot, so a gel insert is not something that you need to factor in when figuring out what size to order.The product info states the heels are 3 1/2 inches and they are, if you only measure to the shortest point of the heel.  From the rubber tip to the top of the heel is 4\" with a narrow platform which is just over a 1/4 of an inch. The heel as depicted in the pictures is a good sturdy one, as opposed to the oh so wobbly spike heel, so that extra 1/2 inch is pretty much not an issue unless there is a reason why you are limited to 3 1/2 inch heels. I have a medium width foot and the width on these shoes is perfect for me.  I think anyone with a narrow or wide foot would have problems.  The ankle strap is nice and long so for anyone who thinks she has cankles, you won't feel as though you are strangling your ankle just by trying to close your shoes.  Unfortunately, the T-strap is just a little too long so it doesn't quite lay flat along the foot as you are walking along, but it is not so bad that I would  take  away a star for it.I have walked around my house wearing these shoes for a couple of hours and so far, no rubbing or toes screaming for release.  For the cherry on top, you can stand up straight while walking, unlike some heels where the angle is so steep you look like you are about to pitch forward onto your face.  We all have great looking heels in our closet which are perfect, if you only have to walk from the car to the restaurant or theater seat.  These shoes not only look good on your feet, they still FEEL good after hours of walking or standing, which we all know is very rare.  You can dress these shoes up or down which makes them very versatile, skinny jeans or that little black dress whichever you choose, these shoes will complement the outfit perfectly!These shoes are a GREAT deal at $22.99 but when you order them in US sizes the price jumps to $57.99, for the exact same shoe and fit by the way!  I ordered the Alpine/Taupe, which turned out to be more like Sage/Moss with the lighter green in leather while the darker green, including the heel made of suede.  The White/Dk Plum/Rosedust pair is more like Purple leather with Eggshell or Offwhite suede and the Rosedust is a very understated pale pink suede scalloping between the purple leather and eggshell suede. So for those of you who live in areas where wet stuff falls from the sky these will not be shoes you can wear year round.  For others like myself, who call the desert home, there will be no reason to wait, you can order these and be raking in the compliments by next week.  One final bit of good news, even though it says $9.99 shipping per pair, this company shipped both pairs in the same box and only charged the one shipping charge, unlike some companies which hit you up for the shipping charge per pair.", "topic": {"id": 7, "label": "fit size wear jean small"}}

There is 0 watches out there like this.Function:It's clearly not made for guys with small wrists, but that's to be expected as most of my bigger watches I always have to clip off an extra slot. After doing that via 5 minutes help from a kitchen knife, I was in action and felt like a million bucks. Regardless of the adjustment, I still prefer to read the smaller bottom left dial as my current time zone as I don't even have to flick my wrist, it's already angled.Appropriate useIf you're feeling like a fresh urbanite...Rock this.That's it.

I'm still able to wear them, but I think US size 9 would've been a better fit. Good quality, however, I'm not sure I like the look. They look a bit different than pictured - the white parts (the upper) are made of patent leather, I think one can't really see it here (in the online images) very well...I mean, I can see it now when I look at the images, now that I've seen these sneakers in person and *know* that the upper is mostly made of patent leather, but I really didn't notice it when I was purchasing these sneakers. Also, the upper is this off white, milky white color, not bright white as pictured. And the soles are bright white (just like pictured) and it just doesn't look good. And I was disappointed by how wrinkled the surface was (the patent leather parts), it looks like the shoes were subjected to too much direct sunlight and/or heat/hot temperatures and got all wrinkled up and turned slightly yellow (and may be that actually is what happened). Also, they look humongous and make feet look bigger than they actually are so I don't know...They are really-really comfortable, easy to put on and a pleasure to walk in, and I LOVE them for their comfort, but I don't think I like the way they look. I think I'll keep them because they are one of the most comfortable sneakers I've ever worn and may be they'll start growing on me and I'll like the look better after I've worn them for a while.", "topic": {"id": 6, "label": "look great good price nice"}}

These jeans almost look grey-ish black in this picture but are in fact perfectly dark blue. Which didn't turn me away in the slightest.I have been wearing Diesel denim for almost a decade now, and they are by far in my opinion still the most well made high end denim around. These are no exception. What you can't tell from the picture, is these are almost a raw material. Very rough even for Diesel standards, but wear them a few times and they will loosen up and form to your body. So perfect. Also, before buying I questioned if the Diesel logo would be on the front pocket (as it looks conspicuously absent in this picture). But don't worry, its there.I feel the Zatiny is the best make from Diesel. Truly the best. But since I prefer a bit of a tapered fit, I get all my Zatiny's bootcut brought in a little for a more skinny look. Now, that of course is up to you, but I'd highly recommend it if you love the style but question the cut! Enjoy.", "topic": {"id": 7, "label": "fit size wear jean small"}}

With more washing I'm sure they will lighten a bit.  I like the slight flare at the bottom.I'm 5 ft 7 155 lbs and got the 31/30.  I had to hem the bottoms as Diesels alwwwwways run long.  They are a good jean for when you are trying to do a dressier night.  You could couple them with a slim fitting sport jacket for a good look.

{"review": "B0026FD3JM Very pretty boots. They are even prettier than pictured. I got mine (my daughter's, to be exact) in purple and the color is very nice, nicer than pictured, it's a warmer, deeper purple. They also appear to be very warm and fairly comfortable and lightweight, though I'm a bit concerned that the sole is not very flexible, it hardly bends. I love the fact that these boots double as snowboots and just regular everyday winter boots - they are waterproof and make great snowboots, but they are also pretty, dressy and comfy enough for everyday wear. The upper is made of suede and nylon, the texture is similar to that of a puffer jacket, and the material is rather thick, which makes the boots really warm. The inside is lined with very soft corduroy and the inner sole is made of leather. The velcro closures make it fast and easy to put the boots on and take them off. The only thing that sort of surprised me was the fur - I had no idea it was real. It does say here that they are rabbit fur trimmed, but I didn't purchase these boots on Amazon, I bought them from another website that didn't mention anything about real fur. I assumed that the fur was fake, it did look fake to me when I was looking at the images of the boots online. When the boots arrived, I was surprised by how soft the fur felt to the touch - much softer than I expected, and then I found a label on the inside of the boots that said \"100% rabbit fur\". I was rather unpleasantly surprised, because it never even occured to me that the fur could be real. It was used only for trimming, the inside of the boot is not lined with fur, it was used for decoration purposes only...I didn't think they would use real fur in children's boots just for decoration purposes. I know that a lot of people feel very strongly about real fur and real fur products and do not wish to buy them so I thought I'd write a review to let everyone know that the fur is real, not fake. However, if that's not a concern, then you and your child will probably like these boots - they are warm, cozy, comfy, very good quality boots, not to mention pretty, especially in purple.", "topic": {"id": 6, "label": "look great good price nice"}}

This watch is a looker not a tech device, so if you are looking for alot of features this watch may not be for you, it has no alarms or frilly things, just a setup, time mode and date option along with the little analog clock.

They feature velcro closures and studded Diesel logo on the side. True to size, great for the price, seemed like a great buy at first.The Bad: Not durable at all! They were worn for may be a few months and the soles on both sneakers started to fall apart - the bottom parts of the soles (the ones with the relief design on them) came almost completely unglued and are about to fall off.The Ugly: The light fabric and especially suede these sneakers are made of get dirty very easily and are very difficult, almost impossible to clean. When I first noticed that the shoes were starting to get (and look) dirty I was able to clean them and almost completely restore them to their original look, after that - not so much. No matter what I tried or how much I cleaned them, I was only able to make them look a little less dirty, but never completely clean. Right now white fabric and light pink suede parts look almost completely grey, and all suede looks completely worn out.

{"review": "B002UNM5D0 I've been looking forward to receiving this shirt - I love Diesel and have never been disappointed by the brand's quality/style before. Well, the shirt arrived today and I like the quality, the fit, the material it's made of (super soft pure cotton), the shirt is true to size (size Medium fits US size 6) and is soft and comfortable...I like everything except the design and the overall look. The design is a lot bolder and brighter than it appears in the photos and even though I absolutely love the concept (golden foil print on black or white), I wish it were executed a bit better. The design takes up the entire front of the shirt, it's too big for my liking, and the way the whole thing is shaped makes for a really unflattering look - it looks like you are wearing a breastplate. And since a medieval knight in (really-really) shining armor is not quite the look I was opting for, I'm now considering sending this shirt back. I'm giving it three stars because I wasn't disappointed in its quality, fit or sizing - it's the design and the look that I didn't like, and I don't want to rate this item too low just because of that. Somebody else might like this shirt a lot - but keep in mind that the foil print is really bright, bold and shiny, it was a little bit too much for my liking. But if you like metallic colors, foil prints and bold, bright clothing you might like this shirt. I got mine in black and it looks pretty good with jeans...I just think it would look a lot better if the design were smaller and a little bit more tasteful.UPDATE: I purchased the same shirt in white and I think it looks much better than the one in black - the foil print doesn't stand out on it as much as it does on the black shirt, it looks a lot more subtle and tasteful.", "topic": {"id": 6, "label": "look great good price nice"}}

He tried the same ones on in the store and they fit the same, so these are not knock-offs like we originally suspected (and one other reviewer). BUT these jeans are not made in Italy and are made in Indonesia instead. After seeing the poor fit this again made us think they were fakes, but the people at the Diesel store said that this is where they \"expanded\" their production to because of \"high demand\". Whatever, they just wanted the cheap labor and are creating a cheaper product instead. You no longer get the Italian colors stitched onto the waistband like the more high quality Diesels.

{"review": "B0036DEW2K I assume that Amazon got a bad batch of the large size purple color of this shirt.  The first one I received had a hole in the collar seam which I assumed was simply a rip.  I just received a replacement and it has the exact same problem.  Upon further inspection, it's clear that the shirt wasn't manufactured properly to begin with as the ribbed collar is bunched up where the hole occurs and the stitching is intact.  In other words, whoever made these shirts for Diesel actually put these together so sloppily that the collar isn't even sewn on properly.  Unless you want to risk having to go through the hassle of returning this item, I'd suggest not ordering it.  I'm sure that Amazon will do right and simply accept my second return without question, but it will mean a second trip to the post office in as many days for me this week.", "topic": {"id": 6, "label": "look great good price nice"}}

{"review": "B003HC7QL4 Fall 2011 had me on a quest to get boots in about every possible color. They say the platform wedge is 'out' for 2012, but darn if I haven't loved the recent sky high trend in platform boots. So because I have so many 6 inch-ers in the closet, the more modest heel and fabulous bright but not glaringly bold color really caught my eye. (Think the shade of a grape popsicle dipped in plum sauce.) Diesel's price had me questioning this tho...as the intentional weathering/scuffing thing so many designers are doing really just makes shoes look beat up, not cool. (in case the photos here don't show up well, there is a lot of intentional abuse to the toe and heel.) But the Unkle Jessy has some redeeming factors: color, comfort, casual chic-ness. The lighter colored canvas toggle embellishment on the shaft distracts a bit, IMO, but overall I found these ideal for tees and jeans. The boot runs a wee bit large, on me, a size 9. But the material used on the sole/heel feels nice and cushy and is non-slip too. Always a good thing, tho it'll be hard to dress them up if that's your goal.  It's challenging to rate the quality of suede because it's rather thin, and, as mentioned, beat up. Had these not been pre-aged, I don't think the suede would be anything to write home about. The toe box is roomy and the shaft dimension is generous-- too generous if you don't want to tuck your skinny jeans. I'd prefer a more form fitting opening for versatility. Bottom line is if you catch them on sale and feel your wardrobe is lacking purple boots, I think these are comfy enough to take a gamble on and unique enough to know not every other chick in the room will be rocking this exact style.", "topic": {"id": 7, "label": "fit size wear jean small"}}

I don't really mind the size running small, because I could have exchanged for a larger one, but it's the thickness, or lack thereof, that made me return it for a refund.", "topic": {"id": 7, "label": "fit size wear jean small"}}

{"review": "B00472MHAS The boot has a suggested retail price of $225.00.  Amazon has it for $180.00. Someone else compared the boot to Doc Martens. Now lets be real. I paid $66.00 for the boots and is questioning that. In fact, the money that I paid should be the suggested retail price. Yes I am aware of the brand name Diesel, and extension of Fossil, yaddie ya, ya. I own a pair of Fossil leather boots that I paid $79.00 for and they are of a much higher quality than these. The boots in all practical appearances seem rugged, (triple stitching, sole sewn to boot, etc.) The toe and heel are not sturdy, and flimsy at best. People let me tell you, NO LINING WHAT SO EVER. The leather outer doubles as the lining. The boot is reinforce with another material at the heel and toe, surely not leather and closer to cardboard. I only got one set of shoe strings. The padded collar, cloth material, is not soft, so you better have on some socks. This boot is great for looks only and will do fine in cool dry weather. Water proof; NOT! Defense against cold weather; NOT! Work boot related; NOT! PROFILING ONLY; yes. So just what did I pay for; you got it, the Diesel name. I have wore boots for almost 30 years, Guess, Doc Martens, The Timberland Boot Company, Aldo, Georgia Boot, Red Wing, etc., no comparison even remotely other than the fact, it falls into the boot category. Top notch Cambodian quality. China would have definitely been a better choice for outsourcing.So, from strictly a fashion stand point, I can work with them, but not for $180.00. Personally, these boots should be the free portion of a buy one get one free campaign of a half decent boot maker.

I took 1 star off because the back didn't sit against my body as nicely as it looked on the model...the big keyhole on the back was a little slouchy on me.  I think this is because the dress itself fits loosely on me, plus with my height, the back part scrunches up.

Next, the wristband is a men's standard and did not fit (I am 6'4\" and 320 pounds). So I have to decide, send it back or fix it. I took it apart and put a new battery in the LCD watch. Then I bought a men's extra long watch band on put it on. Now I can wear the watch!  It does look impressive and I have had several compliments on it. I am disappointed that it is a 5bar but says you cannot wear it swimming.  That is one of the reasons I bought it - so no swimming with it. So 3 disappointments right out of the box. I still think I will keep it because it looks good and has 3 time settings (one is military on the dial). Overall  I give it 4 stars because of the problems.  Otherwise this would be a 5 star watch.Update: I am returning the watch.

{"review": "B004Z2DCZY This hulk of a watch puts most other similarly-sized ones to shame. Others are of crappy quality or are obscenely priced or mega-uncomfortable. I picked the raw steel (silver) with a black face because a)it's a classic b)doesn't have any plating to be scuffed off by friction, time or scratches -just pure stainless steel all over-and it's the cheapest of their line to boot !! I weighed it and it's 235 grs with all the links before resizing the band, which has the diameter to fit the paw of an elephant.Case and bracelet are extremely well machined, matter of fact this is THE best bracelet I've ever had on a watch, and I've had a lot !! Not only are the links extremely thick but smooth to the touch making the band extremely comfy to wear. The clasp has a single spring-loaded lock system and no security lock but clicks firmly in place and feels durable.Now to the watch itself : the design of the case is stunning; it's the only one in the market that can be worn on a 6 3/4  wrist like mine with no overhang of the lugs (yes I tried it at the mall first). Matter of fact the lugs are very short and curve down but very little away from the case for this purpose. Diameter is 50 mm (not 51-52 as advertised) but lug to lug it's just 55 so it will fit most wrists. Word of caution : on wide wrists the lugs may sit and dig on the flesh resulting in discomfort since they end below the line of the caseback. To my pleasant surprise the bezel is not only rotatable but unidirectional with a 120-click ratchet system as oppossed to fixed like stated on the description. The caseback is engraved with the Diesel mohawhk logo in big size.The watch features a functional chronograph in that it can measure laps of time, but the markings on the subdials are too many and lack a logical arrangement, which paired to the tiny size of the dials render the chrono function very difficult and impractical. On such a big-faced timepiece this is paradoxical to say the least. A minor annoyance to me since most of us buy these watches for the looks alone. I've had it for just a couple of days and it has stayed on the second. Bad quality movements may exhibit appreciable variations within just 24 hs. My wish is that it's equipped with a Miyota movement but in most cases the backcase would boast japanese movementon the backcase in capitals so I guess it just has a good chinese movement which aren't bad nowadays.The chrono buttons have a precise and firm engagement action with an audible click and the crown has the most precise operation I've seen on an analog quartz; minutes needle don't move when it's pressed in . I managed to set the time PERFECTLY at the very first try. Upper 24 hs subdial keeps in synch with the hour needle -displaying 24 hs. or military time if you call it that way- and has no relation to the stopwatch noror can be used as a GMT needle which would have been a nice touch. Lower subdial accumulates up to 60 secs and on the left dial minutes up to 30 are displayed. No date which is a bummer especially when the crown has a dead  fist click out position that is typically for date adjustment so the movement is one with date but sorry no date window.CAUTION : 50M is not waterproof, do not wear this watch while swimming. Do not shower or bathe with it or it will fill up with water to the brim. The manual states the fact clearly.get a 100M/10 Bar watch if you need to immerse it in water and have it resealed/repressured every two years.Granted this watch seems as if it were built for the Hulk but it wouldn't look out of place on Bruce Banner ;-)", "topic": {"id": 7, "label": "fit size wear jean small"}}

I also love the textured detail around the edge of the face. Beyond pleased with this purchase. If you're on the fence get it!

There is high design quality and attention to detail.  You will get compliments as most lightweight jackets seem to be of a generic design and contruction.  For $150 retail, this jacket is definitely worth the money.Only problem is fitment.  If your regular size fits you loosely or \"relaxed\" you might be OK getting the same size.  For the other 75% of the people out there, order one size up.  I am 6', 185lb with average joe to athletic build.  I usually order large but the Jurlo jacket is tight in the pecs area.  Unfortunately, the next size up, XL, is a little baggy for my taste but large is too tight up top and should be reserved for the thinner man.

From the fit (fantastic and very true to size) to the color (amazing colors - visually just pop!) these jocks are what every man needs in his wardrobe.  Even after repeated washes the color is still as vibrant as the day I pulled them out of the package.  And ladies (or guys), if you are thinking of giving these as a gift to your special guy, they do come in a very cute package that used paint cans to highlight the colors!The fit is fantastic.  I can wear these day long and have no complaints.  They tend to stay in place, and the straps are very non-irritating and placed well.

{"review": "B005ME7WU0 With age I have developed a foot problem that runs in my family--I have developed a bunion, which is a bony deformity of the joint at the base of the big toe. This makes it difficult to find stylish shoes that can encompass the enlargement of the bone that has occurred at the base of my right big toe.  Sigh.  I can't even stand to say the word, \"bunion\", so you might imagine how I felt about trying to wear \"sensible shoes\" LOL!Diesel to the rescue...I love the Diesel brand and their ultra cool italian style sensibilities.  I wear their jeans, which fit like they were made for me, and last forever, and I also have had many, many shoes from the Diesel line that I have loved and worn to death.  So I was very happy to find these shoes, which have plenty of room in the area across the toe to encompass the slight to moderate enlargement of that area of the bone on my right foot.  I keep the shoes loose in that area, flexing my foot when lacing them so that I have plenty of wiggle room so that the bone doesn't become compressed and cause me pain and suffering while strutting with style.I have found these shoes to be very resilient clean-wise.  I even knocked an oil lamp off a table in my foyer, causing it to break and splatter oil EVERYWHERE, including on a pair of these shoes.  I simply took a hot wet washcloth and soaped it up with dishwashing liquid, and proceeded to clean the surface of these shoes until they looked great again.  They were the Black Night/Black style, and I couldn't believe that they cleaned up so well.I love these shoes so much that I actually own the aforementioned style, as well as the Black Multi, and Bungee Cord/Black/Brown.  In addition, I've bought them in the Raketier style, which is just the same exact shoe with smooth leather accents instead of suede in the Dress Blues/Classic and Bungee Cord/Latigo Bay/Coffee Bean, which I paid way too much for at right about $125, but they are my favorite pair.  The colors are different enough that I don't think anyone would notice that they are the same style--every pair is quite unique.

{"review": "B005OAFMJA These jeans are in stone-washed or sanded heavy blue denim, as accurately depicted in product photos. They have a lowrise hip-sitting style, and straight-cut full leg.  They are well-made, in Tunisia, with strong stitching and rivet reinforcing in the right places, and double belt loops for ease of wear with wide or thin belts. Consistent with the grunge fashion look, washing or sanding has been taken to the stage that the fabric is threadbare or has a couple of actual holes for an instant well-worn appearance. The fly closure is by metal buttons: I prefer zippers. Button fly closure and the relatively high price ($145.99 when I purchased) are the only features of this garment that stop it being five star for me.One of the most notable aspects of this product is that it is offered in longer than regular leg lengths. My 36x36 size is hard to find in men's casual pants or jeans - typically 36-inch waist pants come only in a 34-inch inner leg measurement.Recommended to men with similar problems to me in finding long leg lengths in casual pants, and to anyone looking for this general style.", "topic": {"id": 7, "label": "fit size wear jean small"}}

{"review": "B005YNVSPE I remember owning a pair of Diesel shoes a long time ago and they fell apart right away. I haven't purchased another pair of footwear from Diesel in years, but when I started looking for a pair of flip-flops, these showed up. I figured I would give these a try and I'm glad I did. The quality of the flip-flops is excellent. How can rubber flip-flops be \"well made\"? You will know when you pick these up. They are very comfortable and they feel sturdy. To be honest, I find them much more comfortable than Rainbow flip-flops and there's no breaking in period. However, because the sole is very thin rubber (thinner than most flip-flops), I would not recommend these for long treks anywhere. These should be worn strictly to the beach, grocery store, etc. whenever you don't expect to do too much walking because they offer little protection against the elements. They are expensive, but they look nice and are one of the few things you will find made in Italy. Ordered another pair in black just for some versatility.", "topic": {"id": 7, "label": "fit size wear jean small"}}

So do I return them and get screwed out of another 25% or just keep them and have them bunched up with a tight belt.  I won't be buying any clothes from Amazon.com again.  With this return policy, if it doesn't fit as soon as you pull it out of the box, put it back in box with a big note saying it hasn't been worn, washed or anything...and hopefully you'll get a full refund, but don't count on it.  Amazon seems to think this way of doing business is ok.  They won't be earning any more of my money on clothing.

{"review": "B007C88NHK Wasn't expecting much when I saw this as an Amazon Goldbox Deal of the Day. Usually you expect it to be of items that haven't sold well and that Amazon is just looking to remove from stock. However, these sneakers are pretty darn nice for the price. Consisting of several brown leathers and the customary Diesel strap, it is both stylish and casual. I've worn them out a few times when out with friends at night and have even received a compliment or two on them which is quite rare since I don't even get compliments on my Gucci, Janoskis, Toms, or Costume National sneakers. Its just something about the design of these sneakers that says out to have fun, but with some class I guess.Very comfortable and the Diesel tag does say they will fade and obtain a vintage look over time when worn regularly, but personally I prefer the modern sleek and shine look, so I'll have to keep these guys well-maintained.It also comes with red and brown shoelaces, which is a nice bonus if you want to make these pop a little more with the red.

I'm not talking the permanent kind of wrinkle when your shoes get old, just the wrinkle that appears when you bend the shoe: the top layer of the textile is very thin (nylon?) and it will show too many of those wrinkles whenever the show is not perfectly straight (stretched) - you can actually see it in the pictures.

One thing I didn't expect was that each belt loop is actually 2 loops, which I both like and dislike.  On one hand it's nice when you hang other things off your belt loop, like a keychain (I have my keys on a carabiner).  On the other hand it's a pain trying to get the belt into the inside loop all the way around.When the jeans first arrived the material seemed stiff, but it loosened up without changing shape after being worn a couple times.  I ordered the 34x34, which is what all of my 514s are, and the waist on these jeans are a bit larger, more like 35 than 34.  If I were to buy another pair I'd get the 33 waist instead.Overall these are nice jeans that look great.  But I can get at least 3 pairs of Levi 514 for the same price, and with similar washes that look just as good.  Are these jeans worth the price?

They fit well, hold in the right places, aren't too tight to be considered \"skinny\" but fitted enough to pull of a stylish look with a collared shirt (or Polo), blazer, or t-shirt.  I abhor the \"distressed\" look, so they are a nice departure from that.  Dark indigo, with a few stitching details that are subtle, but appreciated.  And, best of all, as a traveler, jeans tend to be THE heaviest weight in an overnight/weekend back (next to shoes).  These are surprisingly lightweight!Stylish, form-fitting without being tight or skinny, lightweight, dark rich color, can be found at a (Diesel) bargain.

The chronograph and 24 hour subdial feature is subtle and enhances the bold look of the watch. The actual watch looks much better than the picture.I like the quality Japanese movement and the quality made bracelet made in China. Everything about this watch exudes quality build. I was looking at the Nixon 51-30 gold for $500 but it does not have the second sweep hand, no chronograph and no 24 hour analog dial. The Nixon is rated 30 bars vs Diesel's 5 bars but since I am not going to use this watch to go scuba diving I am saving about $300.So, look no further for an awesome big gold watch - you won't regret it.Update: I just purchased the Nixon - 51-30 Chrono - All Gold and that is the ultimate gold bling watch.

The only downside so far is the fact that it is a huge watch but seems a bit difficult to read the time at a glance since it has so much going on. No one aspect of it is big enough to match the size of the watch in my opinion but overall I am happy with it and as a fan of heavy big watches, this is the biggest and heaviest I have ever had.

{"review": "B008BTSBBW I received this watch for Christmas and I love it.  I have an average size wrist and I had to remove one link on each side of the spring release clasp for a perfect fit.  The band also has three holes for fine tuning which would equal one link.  The watch is accurate with two time zone settings, a calender and a stop watch with second display and 30 minute dial.  The face also includes a 24 hour dial that matches up with the main watch movement.  The finish is perfect, with polished, brushed and knurled textures on the stainless steel.  It is water resistant to 3 bar (3 ATM) or 110 feet but it should not be worn while swimming.  In other words it is water resistant for all normal daily water contact such as perspiration or rain.  The watch is beautiful and it will definitely get noticed.  I like the feel and the weight and the huge face of this Diesel watch.  It is easy to set and is adjusted just like any other watch.  I highly recommend this look!", "topic": {"id": 14, "label": "watch love look recommend would"}}

I will definitely try more Diesel shoes in the future, but I will avoic skinny top heavy wedges such as these.", "topic": {"id": 7, "label": "fit size wear jean small"}}

{"review": "B00903X776 I'm a 8.5-9 so decided to order in both sizes to ensure I'd get a good fit--I loved the look of this sneaker so much and typically adore all things Diesel.Unfortunately, I still didn't get anywhere near an ideal fit. The 9 was too long and slipped at my heel w/every step; the 8.5 absolutely squashes my toes! I have a pretty easy-to-fit foot so I have no idea why there's such a stark difference just between half sizes. I ultimately returned the 9 since even with a thick sock they swallowed me. As far as width, they feel like a standard 'M' (B).My biggest gripe was how inconsistent the denim treatment was between the two pair. The pair I had to return was nearly identical to the online image--a cool black faded denim, even toned. The denim on the other pair is super splotchy w/way too much white. Think: early 90s acid wash jeans. Not a good look. The jet black laces just exacerbate all the white, uneven splotches.However, the stud/screw details are up to par. It's edgy without screaming STUDS! They're applied securely and placed just right.There's a little cushion in the footbed; compared to some Chucks and Betsey Johnson hi-tops I own, I'd say they're better designed for comfort...should they actually fit well.The rubber that surrounds Exposure is a nice matte black; the outsole is quality.I can't claim this shoe fits TTS, it's a crap shoot with the denim treatment, and I think they're a wee bit overpriced. Although I kept the smaller pair, it's pretty telling that they've been sitting in the box for 3 weeks, unworn.I'm unwilling to return/reorder/return a shoe that doesn't fit that well just to get the pair I really want: the one in the picture.", "topic": {"id": 7, "label": "fit size wear jean small"}}
{"review": "B009041BAK I just love these sneakers.  I love the style, I especially love the color, and the fit is very comfortable.  The first day I wore them they went to work where I do a lot of running around, then made a Costco run, then went to the food store and out for a bite to eat.  No soreness, no discomfort, no blisters, no rubbing anywhere.  The shoe runs true to length, with plenty of room for toes, and is amply wide enough so your foot can rest comfortably.  The leather is thick, so I don't think these will be good for outdoors in the hot weather, but maybe that's just me.  These are nicely made sneakers.  The stitching is well done, the rubber is glued solidly, and the coloring, which is very unusual, is even and you don't get dye rub-off on your fingers, which I was worried about.", "topic": {"id": 7, "label": "fit size wear jean small"}}

I have worn these to the gym twice and let me tell you I forgot I was even wearing them.  First, they let air in all the right places to keep me cool and dry.  They didn't move; the let straps didn't go anywhere, the band didn't roll or move, the pouch stayed nice and tight.  Like I said, forgot I was even wearing them.My waist is a size 35 and I got mediums.  I probably could get away with a large also, but for working out you want it snug so I got mediums.  I'm also...well endowed and the pouch kept me covered the whole time.One final note, I have very big legs (football thighs that squat 500+ lbs).  I used to wear compression shorts under my gym shorts, but it's too hot now.  Briefs usually are too constricting around my thighs in my groin area, so I've taken to wearing jockstraps under my gym shorts.I got these for $16.99 for the 2 pack but after I got them the price went up.

{"review": "B0091M4ZHW This is a beautiful watch. Yes, it lacks some features that might be nice, like luminous hands and markers and a date window, but it's a big, bold, gorgeous watch. I'm a large guy -- 6'2&#34; and about 250lbs. It is almost too big for me, recognizing that appropriate watch size is really subjective. I come from wearing standard 43 mm or so round dive and dress watches. I have one 46 mm round watch I wear often and it seems tiny in comparison to this watch. It's an industrial fashion statement and the large size seems just about right for pulling off the look Diesel is going for. I have not found a consistent measurement of width online and haven't measured it myself. It is wider than 46 mm that's for sure. I'll update this post once I measure it. I like that the band is the same width all the way around. It does not taper. This is one seriously manly watch and I plan on keeping it. If you're a professional, be prepared for some of the old school people around you to comment on how massive the thing is and maybe even look at you like you've lost your mind.

{"review": "B0094E54NQ I LOVE the design of this watch, so the reason you may be wondering why did I only give it 3 out of 5 stars my explanation is below. The color face design blends with the numbers giving it a rainbow effect at night on the black background. (Love that) After all that's what drew me to it in the first place. As much as I love this watch I was very disappointed in the way the hour and minute hands blended into the black background so much that they seem to have disappeared. I couldn't see them even at different angles. I literally had to twist and turn my wrist towards the light to read the thing. After wearing this for one day I had become so annoyed not being able to see the time that I was ready to return it. The reason that I didn't? I love the design, the shiny look, the smooth color and feel on my wrist, not to mention the complements I've received in just one day of wearing this watch. So I decided to take a chance with it.

{"review": "B00BB92LNI Alright Amazon. I will be honest. I've been working out for quite some time and the results are starting to show nicely. So when I go to the beach I want to show off. Yes I said it. So what better way to do that than some short, bright red, fashion designer swim shorts? A couple of my lady friends loved them so, I daresay they are eye catchers to say the least. I own these in addition to the equally short Diesel Barrely swim shorts and I really enjoy walking around in this bad boy. Few things will make you feel as confident than strutting around in just enough clothing to cover what matters and knowing you look darn good doing it.Now that my egocentric rant is over, Diesel makes high quality clothing no doubt about that. There are no flaws whatsoever in the shorts. No rips or tears, the stitching is great, and the details are subtle, but well done. The fabric is a nice nylon that follows the countour of the body very nicely, especially if you work out your legs (which I DO, 205 pound squats ladies and gentlemen), but doesn't cling. There are two side pockets, and a back pocket outlined by silver trim with a silver metal accent hanging from the zipper. Again, subtle, but nice. The shorts read \"Diesel, Take a Ride on the Freaky Side\" on the back. No comma, granted. That's kind of a funny statement, I have yet to whip that one out on a beach girl, but I'm sure the opportunity will present itself in the future.These are great shorts if, like me, you've been feeling good about your physique and want to work it a little bit, as much as a guy can work it I guess. I make no apologies for that choice of words. A note though, these go by European sizes. I am normally a 30\" waist on US sizes but I was a 28\" with these shorts and even then I wish they were maybe a quarter of an inch slimmmer in the waist.So, if you're feeling ballsy, order, and have fun!", "topic": {"id": 7, "label": "fit size wear jean small"}}

{"review": "B00BEN3EEQ I've been slowly transitioning over to designer swimwear lately. Why? Because designer fits so much better than a cheap pair of board shorts from a superstore; more often than not it's like wearing a boat sail around your waist. The amount of excess material is just insanity.Diesel's Kroobeach Board Short is another example of the high quality, well fitting clothing Diesel makes. What's even better is catching deal on Amazon where you can acquire designer items without burning a hole in your pocket. Actually in most cases with designer prices, taking a flamethrower to your pants. Or wherever your house your wallet. The shorts look exactly how is pictured, perhaps a little looser closer to the knee for me as I am still working on bulking up my legs in my weight-lifting. If I had to sum the fit up in a single statement it would be just enough material. Not baggy, but not tight. A reviewer seems to be unaware that these come in a Size 28 which I recommend getting if you are normally arounda 30\" waist in American sizes.The fabric feels a little thinner than swimsuits I've had in the past but honestly thinner doesn't mean lower quality. Diesel is well known for making superior fabrics in their items and I feel the Kroobeach is no exception; the shorts are very well-made from the fabric to the stitching and I have no doubt they will last for a long time. Aesthetically, there's the belt loops (just for show), back pockets and a button front which is a nice change from a drawstring. As far as the pockets go, I wouldn't expect them to function too well. Diesel was obviously shooting for the look of actually wearing some type of shorts which is kind of cool in my opinion. Other than that there's not much more to review than what you can't already see. As far as board shorts go these are pretty \"no-frills\".These are great board shorts. If you like the look definitely snag a pair!", "topic": {"id": 7, "label": "fit size wear jean small"}}

{"review": "B00BGGR7YE I just got these, arrived right on time (thank you Amazon.com), and they look amazing.  Contrary to what many have stated here, they do not run small at all.  I watched a youtube video review and the reviewer gave some great tips on how to get these on and off, I followed his instructions and they are easier to take on and off than many of my other boots.  And a note about the size;  I normally wear a size 9.  In most dress shoes I have to go up to a size 9.5 so they will fit my slightly wide feet, so I ordered a 9.5 in these since many were saying they ran a tad small.  The 9.5's fit me perfectly!Build Quality:  They are very light weight and the zipper feels a bit cheap, but I hope by following the suggestions I received to always make sure they are not laced up so tight it puts pressure on the zipper, they will last a very long time.  If the zipper fails early, I'll update this review.  The laces &#34;feel&#34; cheap, but I suspect it's due to the style, they are very light and FLAT laces with a coating on them.  Again, if they prove to fail on me earlier than they should I'll update.Looks:  They look amazing!  Love these boots, they moved up to my favorite footwear instantly as soon as I pulled them out of the box.Comfort:  From putting them on and walking around the house, they feel like a pair of sneakers or deck shoes.  Good arch support but not a whole lot of cushioning.  I'm not sure how they will feel walking around in them all day since the padding is much less than my other boots, but as mentioned above, I'll update if there are any issues.  The leather is very soft, so I don't think there will be much breaking in needed, they are very comfortable right out of the box.For the price I paid (about half price through Amazon.com) these are an exceptional buy.

{"review": "B00C40WIU4 As far as delivery goes, it arrived on time. Now as far as the product goes... First off this is only my observation and opinion; I probably wouldn't have given a review in order to keep this product under wraps, because its that good!!!, I wanted to keep this a secret and not tell anyone about it. But how else would the company know if its good or not, so that they could make more of these kind. The comfort is amazing, because the material/fabric is absolutely amazing, smooth, soft and very silk like and stretchy, but just snug enough to hold everything in place. And the best thing is that it doesn't have that ugly CONTOUR LINE in the front pouch, which is very uncomfortable and which is one of the biggest errors a lot of other companies make. I hope that other underwear companies change that and follow this as an example. Again the fabric is awesome, but they could have made the elastic on the waist a bit wider and stronger, but over all this product is amazing. What is even better, is that my girl loves them, and thinks that the feel of them is very smooth and nice.", "topic": {"id": 6, "label": "look great good price nice"}}
{"review": "B00C40WIU4 Now these are some comfy undies. These Diesel Microfiber Briefs might be the most comfortable things to ever have encased my boys. They are well made, comfortable, very well priced especially for Diesel, and are stylish to boot for activities in which pants are not necessarily a necessity. Try saying THAT five times fast.For those who don't know, Diesel is a European fashion clothing company renown for their high quality, well-fitting clothing; jeans especially. This quality and fit comes at a premium however and most items of Diesel clothing will make your wallet cringe in fear. So considering each of these pairs of briefs are about $14 apiece, that is a steal. Now you might be thinking &#34;Well okay, but for that money I can get multiple pairs of Hanes at Target or something.&#34; To which I say shame on you. Treat your equipment with some respect okay? For pity's sake.Diesel made the Blade Microfiber Brief with every once of quality the company is known for. The Microfiber material is very soft and lovely to the touch and no I don't mean with your fingers. The material stretches very well and doesn't feel like the threads will come loose, the fabric will be damaged, or that the waistband will fray, nothing like that. These are very well made briefs. So while yes each one comes with some premium, you get your money's worth.The fit is also spectacular. I have a pretty small waistline so a small was the go-to choice. I ordered seven colors and every single one fits perfectly. The briefs are not too tight, but not too loose, and I think have a bit of a low-rise. The only complaint I have with the fit is that the waistband feels like it could use slightly more cinching but the briefs don't slide down or ride up (briefs in general don't really do this due to the lack of material that can ride up your leg which is why I like them so much) so I can't really, nor want to, dock any stars off for that. These briefs also have the the fly opening for when nature calls. This is a nice touch; many briefs don't have this so more points to Diesel on that one.Gentlemen, quality underwear matters. Don't buy the cheap stuff just to have something. Spend some money and build up a nice underwear drawer you'll be looking forward to wearing and wearing in front of the ladies when, not if, when that crucial time comes. Your junk and your confidence will both thank your brain and your wallet. Wear them proudly my friends!", "topic": {"id": 7, "label": "fit size wear jean small"}}

{"review": "B00C57NIVO Now I know that I need to size up even more than I did. The jeans that fit me range from  27 (in stretchy Joe's) to 29 (in most  J Crew jeans and Red Engine jeans), depending on the cut and stretchiness of fabric. In the Diesel Getlegg, I have worn a 28, and find it gives me a little room to move and breathe. In these Skinzees, The 29 was too small. I'm going to try the 30 and 31 and see what works best. But my advice is to size up in these. I'll post again once I see if I have to go up one size or two.The Hunter color has very obvious fading/sanding in the usual areas, which you can see from the photo.

{"review": "B00DN59HVC With age I have developed a foot problem that runs in my family--I have developed a bunion, which is a bony deformity of the joint at the base of the big toe. This makes it difficult to find stylish shoes that can encompass the enlargement of the bone that has occurred at the base of my right big toe. Sigh. I can't even stand to say the word, &#34;bunion&#34;, so you might imagine how I felt about trying to wear &#34;sensible shoes&#34; LOL!Diesel to the rescue...I love the Diesel brand and their ultra cool italian style sensibilities. I wear their jeans, which fit like they were made for me, and last forever, and I also have had many, many shoes from the Diesel line that I have loved and worn to death. So I was very happy to find these shoes, which have plenty of room in the area across the toe to encompass the slight to moderate enlargement of that area of the bone on my right foot. I keep the shoes loose in that area, flexing my foot when lacing them so that I have plenty of wiggle room so that the bone doesn't become compressed and cause me pain and suffering while strutting with style.I love these shoes so much that I actually own them in Dress Blues/Classic and Bungee Cord/Latigo Bay/Coffee Bean, which I paid way too much for at right about $125, but they are my favorite pair. In addition, I've bought them in the Aramis style, which is just the same exact shoe with suede leather accents instead of the smooth leather of the Raquetier in Black Night/Black, Black Multi, and Bungee Cord/Black/Brown.  The colors are different enough that I don't think anyone would notice that they are the same style--every pair is quite unique. I absolutely LOVE these shoes!!I have found these shoes to be very resilient clean-wise. I even knocked an oil lamp off a table in my foyer, causing it to break and splatter oil EVERYWHERE, including on one of the pairs of the Aramis shoes--the Black Night/Black ones. I simply took a hot wet washcloth and soaped it up with dishwashing liquid, and proceeded to clean the surface of these shoes until they looked great again. I couldn't believe that they cleaned up so well.I have always ordered a whole size larger in Diesel shoes, even before my foot problems, as I find that they run small.", "topic": {"id": 7, "label": "fit size wear jean small"}}

I can't even believe I found this, let alone that it's Diesel, but leave it to Amazon to have everything! Unfortunately, there wasn't a sizing guideline on Amazon, and Diesel's own website was equally unhelpful. I kept searching the internet and really found no information. So, knowing the sizing of this shirt is to fit 2yr olds to 7 yr olds in xxs-large, I made a presumption that the xs would fit my average-sized boy. I was a little wrong, as the shirt is a little big for him, but the good news is that it'll probably fit him until he's 6 yrs old. As far as the shirt goes, the material is of good quality, isn't too thin, has not shrunk (he's worn this 3 times in 6 days, and after 3 washes, is still the same size), and the design is nicely printed. It has a bit of a vintage element to the design, purposefully a little faded, and looks really cool. It's printed in a thinner ink, so it feels comfortable on the body, unlike old fashioned iron ons or appliqu&eacute;s.

My shoe size is 9, I ordered 9.5 just in case, but i bet that I would have been fine with a size 9.

The 7.5 are still a little big but better a little big than a little small--I can always wear thicker socks and once I put my comfy insole in the fit will probably be better.

I also got them on a sale that Amazon was running bringing them within my price range. (The full price is a little high for me.) The softness makes them really feel like well-aged jeans, and the contemporary stretchiness makes them more comfortable than some of my actual old jeans. My size varies between 27 and 29 depending on the cut. In these, I am a 28, which is what I would call true to size. However, my hips and legs are slim, so it's possible if you have fuller hips you might have to go up a size. My waist is not as small as in my youth - that's my tough to fit part - but these jeans definitely have a low rise, making the waist size less of an issue.

{"review": "B00HO7E2Y2 Let me say first that I am a regular Diesel jeans customer. I know most people do not consider &#34;normal&#34; to spend 200-300 bucks in a pair of jeans. This, however, is a matter of style and, thus, this review is intended for people with an acquired taste for premium jeans brands.I have owned more than 15 jeans from this brand,  including styles as Safado, Darron, Biker and Belther. When I bought my first Diesel jeans I began using Safados, but these jeans have a very skinny fit and I have reasonably thick thighs (I ride my bicycle everyday), so I changed into a more &#34;relaxed&#34; style and I started buying Belthers and Darrons, which are still skinny fit jeans but not that skinny around the thighs.Bottom line, I received these jeans and I immediately fell in love with them from the moment I put my eyes on them. However, surprisingly these jeans somehow have a &#34;Safado&#34; fit (i.e. they have a very skinny fit around the thighs).I am not returning these 'cause I really liked them, but it did made me unhappy to see that these Belthers did not have the type of fit I am used to.In the overall, if you do not have the same issue I do with my thighs, do not hesitate to buy these jeans.

{"review": "B00HZEVBG6 There are no jeans 'for summer', as you're gonna sweat anyhow, but those are relatively soft and thin.The looks is less bright than the picture, the main color is *very typical* light blue rather than 'almost white'. That's dissapointing, as in the picture it looks special but in realy it's just like any other bright jeans. For that price I'd have expected Diesel to create more significant constast in colors, not just use a standard pattern. 1 star dropped.Some say the Waykee is a 'slim straght' but I don't think it's slim, it's a regular str8 IMO. They look really good on the body, not restricting and 'heavy to move in' like some other jeans. 100% cotoon means they're relatively 'breathing' too.They are expensive, however I don't own manny jeans at all (expect those I have only 2 more), as I don't like how modern fits sit on my body.. Personally I don't think a man should look like a carrot, but that's not what fashion designers think as everything today is tight and the leg opennings are tiny small.So if you just want to look like a MAN, but still owning jeans which look much better and stylish than any 50$ un-branded one, I think the Waykee worth the price, as it really looks super cool.Diesel's former 'Straight' fit (larkee) was too 'relaxed' for me, I think the new Waykee fit is much sexier and looks better. Maybe a bit more conservative.", "topic": {"id": 7, "label": "fit size wear jean small"}}

{"review": "B00JRQQFQ6 I have worn several pair of Diesels since the late 1980s.  The Safado is one of my favorite cuts ever, however; it is for a specific body type and depends on what one looks for in jeans.  I'm 6-1 and fit.  I have long legs.  These pants fit great.  They have enough stretch that they never pull.  They have enough that they don't stretch out after a few hours and not fit.  I've worn them several days without a belt and it was only after six or seven days of wearing that I needed a belt.  This is key for me with jeans.  These fit medium to low and lower as one wears them between washings.  The fit is tight in the thighs and them tapers from the knee.  The bottom is a slimmer opening which I love.  They look better as one wears them between washings.  I wash them as little as possible and I highly suggest washing them on gentle cycle in addtion to cold and inside out.  I've thrown them in the sink with woolite and prefer to do that were it not for time constraints.My one issue with Diesel is that it is not necessarily made in Italy anymore.  Nothing beats a good pair of pants made in Italy.  They started making them in Romania and the fit was a bit different, in general, with all Diesel.  I'm glad they are still made in the EU.  I hated seeing these go outside of Italy.  However, once I learned the newer fits, the Romanian made Diesel was still pretty good.  Now I see these are being made in Morocco. I fear the fit is going to be different and the quality not as it was.  This being said, I do not know.These are great jeans if you are looking for something a big snug but stretchy.  They tend to fit tighter in the thigh area than the waist and a lot of people have problems with that.  I personally like it.  They feel great out of the box.  I have had several pair and do the most to not wear them in as they are already designed to be such.", "topic": {"id": 7, "label": "fit size wear jean small"}}
{"review": "B00JRQQFQ6 You know these are solid jeans before you even open the sealed black plastic bag.  When they arrived, I was surprised by how heavy the bag felt for jeans.  Even though these are distressed jeans you don't fear these ripping anytime soon.  They are heavy and strong.To help people get the right sizing, I will add my comments.  These are slim jeans but not skinny jeans.I wear size 33/32 for every type of pants.  In almost every case, the fit is perfect around the wait with dress pants always staying the same and jeans giving a little (stretching).  I end up needing a belt after awhile, but I like belts for fashion sense anyway.  These jeans were exactly the same for waist size.  A perfect fit right out of the bag.  The length was another story.  I guess it is &#34;in&#34; to wear slim jeans with the bottom of the pants rolled up once or twice, and with these, you would have ample space.  I would say that these are more like 33/34 and that is ok with me but if these were dress pants they would be going back.  For anyone who has the same fit for all their pants, 33/32 in my case - I would probably want 33/31 and I highly doubt that is a size option.  33/30 would probably be a perfect fit just touching the tops of my shoes...  that is how much extra length is available in these pants.  I am an older guy and I don't want to roll up the bottom of my pants and I can manage.  These are low riding on the hips and tighter in the thighs just as expected.  If you have a slimmer figure with bigger thighs like me, they have a nice tight fit in the thighs and getting looser from the knees down with a tighter fit at the ankles.  If you know you size, I would definitely think twice about the length unless you want to fold these up at the bottom.Great quality, thick and strong, great distressed look and fit.  You get what you pay for...", "topic": {"id": 7, "label": "fit size wear jean small"}}

{"review": "B00K248D1C Normally I have to size up for Diesel jeans but these run big in the waist, rise, and seat, so when I tried them on they were \"swimming\" on me. They are meant to sit low on the hip but then they bunch up in the front and look unflattering. I am sending these back and am choosing another boyfriend Deisel jean in two sizes down because I like the style and the idea of boyfriend jeans without actually buying men's jeans, which I have done in the past without much luck.", "topic": {"id": 7, "label": "fit size wear jean small"}}
{"review": "B00KNCCU6W These jeans are amazing quality and extremely flattering! They are such a cool material too almost like a coated denim? Its hard to describe, they are just so smooth and refined looking. These are totally worth the price. It seems like this particular one is out of stock at the moment but try the diesel grupee in other washes! Just be aware diesel run a size small. Im normally a 27 and in this brand I'm a 28.", "topic": {"id": 6, "label": "look great good price nice"}}
